0	1	Measuring health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis: comparing the clinimetric properties of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) [SEP] STUDY QUESTION: Which of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is the most efficient to assess quality of life in women suffering from endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although EHP-5 and EQ-5D instruments had an excellent responsiveness, EHP-5 has a better discriminative ability than EQ-5 to measure health-related quality of life (HrQoL). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Proper measurement of HrQoL is important in endometriosis. While many quality of life instruments are available, few have been completely validated in endometriosis. The EHP-5 and the EQ-5D are short and practical scales, which may be useful. Literature is lacking to determine which one is the most suitable in clinical practice or in clinical research. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective and observational study conducted between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 included a total of 253 consecutive women with proven endometriosis, undergoing medical or surgical treatment, in 2 French tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: Women over 18 years consulting for painful symptoms of at least 3 months' duration or for infertility, with endometriosis proven histologically or radiologically, were requested to fill in the 2 scales before (T0) and 12 months after treatment (T1) Construct validity consisted in testing presupposed relationships between the scales and the characteristics of the patients or the endometriosis Responsiveness to change was calculated for all patients and in each treatment group. Effect sizes were used according to Cohen's d method. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 216 women filled in completely all the questionnaires at T0 and 133 (61.6%) at T1. EHP-5 and EQ-5D had good discriminative abilities regarding the patients' symptoms, with significant superiority of EHP-5 concerning three of the nine hypotheses. The largest difference was that calculated for the 'intensity of dysmenorrhea' using the Visual Analogic Scale, with respectively effect size from Cohen's d (ES) = 0.86 95% CI (0.54-1.17) for EHP-5 versus 0.48 95% CI (0.16-0.79) for EQ-5D. There were no differences in EHP-5 or in EQ-5D scores between subgroups according to the characteristics of endometriosis. Overall responsiveness was excellent and equivalent for EHP-5 and for EQ-5D, with, respectively, ES = 0.81 95% CI (0.56-1.56) versus ES = 0.95 95% CI (0.68-1.20). In subgroup analyses, EHP-5 was responsive in case of medical treatment with ES = 0.93 95% CI (0.07-1.70), whereas EQ-5D was not, ES = 0.73 95% CI (-0.06-1.47). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our study population included patients with symptomatic and mainly severe forms of endometriosis, which may suggest a spectrum bias. The evaluation of responsiveness in case of medical treatment was based on a small number of patients, which limits the interpretation of the difference found between the two scales in this subgroup WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: EHP-5 is a simple, efficient and valid tool for evaluating quality of life in daily practice and also valuable to provide a primary outcome in clinical studies evaluating treatment efficacy. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was funded by the Direction à la Recherche Clinique et à l'Innovation of Versailles, France. The authors have no conflicts of interest.

1	1	Adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L improves its psychometric performance in the general population [SEP] BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and often disturbing sequela of serious chronic health conditions. In the widely applied HRQL instrument, the EQ-5D, this aspect is not included directly, for its assumed lack of additional information. We investigated the validity of this assumption by determining the gain-if any-of an additional fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L in a general population sample. METHODS: A Dutch general population sample (including diseased people) completed a web-based survey including the EQ-5D-5L and the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). The RPQ fatigue item was used to create the EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue. We head-to-head compared the psychometric performance contrasting the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue: distribution (e.g ceiling), informativity cf. Shannon's indices, convergent validity, domain dependency, and explanatory power. Results were compared between subgroups with and without ≥ 1 chronic health condition. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 3027 persons of whom 52% had a chronic health condition. The mean EQ-5D-5L utility score was 0.83 and 48% experienced some degree of fatigue. Adding the fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L decreased the ceiling effect, increased absolute informativity (H' = 6.44 vs. H' = 4.90) and relative informativity (J' = 0.46 vs J' = 0.42). The extra fatigue item slightly increased convergent validity (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = - 0.61 vs. - 0.62). Domain dependency analysis showed that all EQ-5D-5L domains are dominant over the fatigue item Explanatory power of the EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue was higher compared to the EQ-5D-5L (R(2) = 0.42 vs. 0.39). The gain is substantially larger in the subgroup with chronic health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L improved all psychometric performance criteria of the enriched instrument in the general population. Effects are substantially larger in the subgroup with chronic health conditions, indicating that adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L is especially relevant in evaluating the HRQL of diseased people [SEP] Bolt-on; EQ-5D; Fatigue; General population; Health-related quality of life
2	1	"The number of patients ""worse than death"" while waiting for a hip or knee arthroplasty has nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic [SEP] AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients on the waiting list for a total hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (KA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary aims were to assess whether length of time on the waiting list influenced quality of life and rate of deferral of surgery. METHODS: During the study period (August and September 2020) 843 patients (THA n = 394, KA n = 449) from ten centres in the UK reported their EuroQol five dimension (EQ-5D) scores and completed a waiting list questionnaire (2020 group). Patient demographic details, procedure, and date when listed were recorded. Patients scoring less than zero for their EQ-5D score were defined to be in a health state ""worse than death"" (WTD). Data from a retrospective cohort (January 2014 to September 2017) were used as the control group. RESULTS: The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic Increasing length of time on the waiting list was associated with decreasing quality of life.

3	0	Direct and Indirect Pathways for Health-Related Quality of Life Change from Pain Improvement in Neuropathic Pain Patients with Spine Diseases: Path Analysis with Structural Equation Modeling Using Non-Interventional Study Results of Pregabalin [SEP] BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain or chronic cervical pain often has a neuropathic pain (NeP) component and patients with these conditions complain of sleep deprivation, loss of physical function, and reduced productivity due to pain. The objective of this study was to clarify the pathway by which pain, sleep disturbance due to pain, and physical function status influence QOL measures in chronic low back pain patients with NeP associated with lumbar spine diseases (CLBP-NeP) and in chronic cervical pain patients with NeP associated with cervical spine diseases (CCP-NeP). METHODS: A model assuming pain numeric rating scale (NRS), pain-related sleep interference scale (PRSIS), and functional indices (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ], Neck Disability index [NDI]) as factors that can affect outcomes such as QOL (calculated using EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) was developed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Overall trends were frequently observed in both patients with CLBP-NeP and CCP-NeP. Pain NRS had the largest comprehensive direct impact on QOL based on EQ-5D and an overall impression of changing symptoms. The effects of pain NRS on each outcome were largely due to direct pain-related effects; however, for EQ-5D, an indirect effect via functional improvement was the primary factor. CONCLUSION: Although the results of this study suggest that the indirect functional improvement of pain relief may not be recognized as a significant component of therapeutic effects by both physicians and patients, the pain-relieving intervention contributes directly to improvement of patients' overall QOL and also indirectly via functional improvement in Japanese primary care settings. Accordingly, to achieve the therapeutic goal for patients with NeP and minimize the impact of pain burden, our findings indicate that pain relief interventions are also crucial from the perspective of the patient's HRQOL [SEP] EuroQoL 5 Dimensions; function; neuropathic pain; pregabalin; spine diseases; structural equation modeling
4	1	Estimation of Health Utilities Based on the Response to Treatment in Atopic Dermatitis: a Population-based Study [SEP] PURPOSE: This study estimated utility weights based on the response to treatment for atopic dermatitis in the general population. METHODS: The Korean general population aged 20-60 years was stratified by using a random sampling method based on age and sex. Two hypothetical health states of atopic dermatitis were developed: response to treatment and no response to treatment. Health utility values were estimated by using time trade-off (TTO) based on a period of 10 years, TTO based on life expectancy, and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) including a visual analog scale (VAS). The mean utility value and 95% CI were derived, and comparisons of subgroups using the t test and ANOVA were performed. We conducted a multilevel analysis after controlling the sociodemographic variables to consider repeated measures. FINDINGS: A total of 155 participants were included in the survey. Their mean age was 39.7 years; 58.7% of participants were women The mean health utility values for response and no response using TTO based on 10 years were 0.847 and 0.380, respectively. The estimated health utility values of response and no response were 0.865 and 0.476 using TTO based on life expectancy, and 0.814 and 0.279 using EQ-5D. For VAS, the response and no response were 0.744 and 0.322. After controlling the covariates, the important factors that affected utility values were response and no response to treatment (P < 0.001) IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that the utility weights of people with no response to atopic dermatitis treatment were lower compared with response from the general population. Health care providers should therefore consider symptom control as an important factor affecting the quality of life of those with atopic dermatitis [SEP] Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic/therapy; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; EQ-5D; atopic dermatitis; quality of life; time trade-off; utility weights; visual analog scale
5	1	Examining the association between menstrual symptoms and health-related quality of life among working women in Japan using the EQ-5D [SEP] BACKGROUND: Menstrual symptoms have been identified as a substantial burden among women of reproductive age, affecting their health status and quality of life globally. A range of menstrual symptoms have been studied as they affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), showing variations across specific menstrual symptoms and study settings. A major concern is demonstrated due to menstrual symptoms in women's professional and social life, and consequently societal and economic loss for women and the society at large. Yet evidence is scarce that estimates the index form HRQoL score related to menstrual symptoms that is needed for health economic evaluations. METHODS: This study aims to investigate the association between menstrual symptoms and the HRQoL among working women in Japan in an index form, using a self-reporting questionnaire (n = 6048). The EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL 5-dimension 3-level) is used that is a widely used tool to measure health outcomes for health economic evaluations globally Multivariate regression analysis is conducted to assess the association between the HRQoL score and specific nineteen physical and mental conditions related to menstruation (e.g., pain, heavy bleeding, concentration, negative affect) RESULTS: The index form HRQoL score for menstrual symptoms is estimated as 0.682 in the study population (where a score one suggests perfect health). The association of the HRQoL score varies substantially across the menstrual symptoms. Several of the physical conditions and disorders show a substantial negative association with the HRQoL score. Also, most of the mental and psychological issues are significantly and negatively related to the HRQoL score CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HRQoL is substantially and negatively affected by menstruation among working women in Japan. Distinct variations of negative influences across menstrual symptoms underscore the multi-dimensional nature of menstruation and consequently the need of collective interventions to address these difficulties. The evidence of HRQoL continues to be an important area for future research on women's health and health economic evaluations to inform effective and efficient resource allocations for relevant health policies and financing strategies [SEP] Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Japan/epidemiology; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Women, Working; EQ-5D; EQ-5D-3L; Health economic evaluations; Health related quality of life (HRQoL); Japan; Menstrual symptoms; Menstruation; Quality of life (QoL); Utility values
6	1	Estimating Informal Caregiving Time from Patient EQ-5D Data: The Informal CARE Effect (iCARE) Tool [SEP] BACKGROUND: Families and friends provide a considerable proportion of care for patients and elderly people. Caregiving can have substantial effects on caregivers' lives, health, and well-being. However, because clinical trials rarely assess these effects, no information on caregiver burden is available when evaluating the cost effectiveness of treatments. OBJECTIVE: This study develops an algorithm for estimating caregiver time using information that is typically available in clinical trials: the EQ-5D scores of patients and their gender METHODS: Four datasets with a total of 8012 observations of dyads of caregivers and a gamma model with a log-link estimated with the Bayesian approach were used to estimate the statistical association between patient scores on the EQ-5D-3L dimensions and the numbers of hours of care provided by caregivers during the previous week. The model predicts hours of care as mean point estimates with 95% credible intervals or entire distributions. RESULTS: Model predictions of hours of care based on the five EQ-5D dimensions ranged from 13.06 (12.7-14.5) h/week for female patients reporting no health problems but receiving informal care to 52.82 (39.38-66.26) for male patients with the highest level of problems on all EQ-5D dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The iCARE algorithm developed in this study allows researchers who only have patient-level EQ-5D data to estimate the mean hours of informal care received per week, including a 95% Bayesian credible interval Caregiver time can be multiplied with a monetary value for caregiving, enabling the inclusion of informal care costs in economic evaluations. We recommend using the tool for samples that fall within the confidence intervals of the characteristics of our samples: men (age range 47.0-104.2 years), women (age range 55-103 years) [SEP] Caregivers/economics; Cost of Illness; Health Care Costs; Humans; Models, Econometric; Netherlands; Patient Care/economics; Quality of Life; Reimbursement Mechanisms; Surveys and Questionnaires

Challenges and innovative adaptations used in Egypt: a cross-sectional study [SEP] OBJECTIVES: To present the challenges and adaptations done to the EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) protocol to fit the Egyptian culture during the extensive pilot phase of the Egyptian EuroQol 5 Dimension five level (EQ-5D-5L) valuation study DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional, interviewer-administered face-to-face survey of representative Egyptians using the Arabic version of the EuroQol Group Valuation Technology (EQ-VT-2.1) and a country specific questionnaire pertaining to participants' demographics and opinions about health, life and death SETTING: Participants were recruited from workplaces, university campuses, sporting clubs, shopping malls and other public areas from different Egyptian governorates representing all geographical areas of the country. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1378 participants were interviewed from July 2019 to March 2020 by 12 interviewers to select a representative sample in terms of: geographical distribution, age and gender, of which 75 participants did not complete the interview, 298 interviews were pilot and 1005 interviews were real of which 974 interviews were used for the valuation study. Two participants did not complete the country-specific questionnaire but completed the valuation protocol; therefore, 1301 interviews were included in the final analysis of country specific questions. RESULTS: Some modifications were applied to the protocol. The 'wheelchair example' was modified to 'migraine example' since most of the participants in the pilot interviews considered being in a wheelchair 'worse than dead'. There was some ambiguity in the Egyptian translated version for the EQ-5D-5L between levels 4 and 5 of the pain and depression dimensions This was overcome by using colour coding to express the different levels of severity. A pictorial representation for the EQ-5D-5L health states was used to interview illiterate and less educated participants. CONCLUSION: In the Egyptian valuation study, the modifications made to the EQ-VT protocol made it feasible and culturally acceptable to the Egyptian participants [SEP] Cross-Sectional Studies; Egypt; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology; health economics; health policy; qualitative research
8	1	Health related quality of life and mortality 10 years after a femoral neck fracture in patients younger than 70 years [SEP] BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A femoral neck fracture (FNF) may have long term effects on the patient's health related quality of life (HRQoL) and mortality, especially in patients younger than 70 years. These long-term effects are unknown since most studies have a short follow-up. The aim of this study was to investigate self-assessed hip function, HRQoL and factors associated with 10-years mortality after a FNF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective multicenter study with a 10-year follow-up of patients aged 20-69 years with a displaced and non-displaced FNF treated with closed reduction and internal fixation. The self-administered questionnaires EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Hip Disability Outcome Score (HOOS) were used. Results of EQ-5D and HOOS was compared to sex and age matched general population data of Sweden. All patients that were deceased had their death date recorded. Factors associated with mortality were assessed by regression analysis of the baseline data including age, gender, harmful alcohol consumption according to AUDIT, co-morbidity measured by ASA-grade, body mass index, osteoporosis measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and smoking. Prevalence of co-morbidities and smoking was compared to general population data. RESULTS: From initial 182 included patients, 55 were deceased at 10-year follow-up, 4 were deregistered from public record and 35 declined participations. A total of 88 patients participated through self-administrated questionnaires. There were no significant differences in HOOS between gender and fracture type and the results were equivalent to general population data. The EQ-5D continued to improve compared to a 24-month follow-up (p = 0.006) but did not recover to pre-fracture level (p<0.001) though it was equivalent to general population data. Higher age, co-morbidity, osteoporosis and smoking were associated with increased mortality within 10 years after the fracture and the prevalence of co-morbidity and smoking was higher than the general population INTERPRETATION: Those patients who had survived 10 years after a FNF treated with CRIF had a HRQoL and hip function equivalent to age and sex matched general population of Sweden. However, a third of these relatively young patients had deceased 10 years after the hip fracture and they were more compromised than the general population [SEP] Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Femoral Neck Fractures/surgery; Humans; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Sweden/epidemiology; Treatment Outcome; Femoral neck fractures; Health related quality of life; Hip disability outcome score; Hip fractures in younger patients; Younger than 70 years of age
9	1	"A Comparison of Patient-Centered Outcome Measures to Evaluate Dysphagia and Dysphonia After Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion [SEP] OF BACKGROUND DATA: Dysphagia and dysphonia are the most common complications after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF). No consensus system exists currently in the spine literature for the classification of these conditions postoperatively. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) in the assessment of dysphagia when compared with the Bazaz score. A secondary goal was to assess the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) scores among patients following ACDF. METHODS: Patients treated with ACDF (one, two, or three level) for cervical radiculopathy and/or cervical myelopathy at two tertiary hospitals were administered patient-reported outcome metrics preoperatively as well as at multiple time points postoperatively. The metrics administered included the EAT-10, VHI-10, Bazaz, Neck Disbability Index, and EuroQol Five Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)/visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in this study. Eighty-nine percentage had a 1-year follow-up, and 100% had a 12-week follow-up. Mean Neck Disbability Index, EQ-5D, and EQ-visual analog scale scores all improved from baseline at both 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Both the EAT-10 and VHI-10 demonstrated excellent internal reliability (α = 0.95 and α = 0.90, respectively). Analysis of variance of EAT-10 and VHI-10 scores by time point demonstrated a statistically significant relationship (P < 0.0001). The EAT-10 and VHI-10 scores were statistically greater on postoperative day 1 than at all other times (Tukey posthoc, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.004, respectively) Across all time points, 176 instances of clinically significant dysphagia (EAT-10 ≥ 3) were noted, 57 (32%) of which were classified as ""None"" on the Bazaz classification. CONCLUSIONS: The EAT-10 score is an accurate measure for mild to severe dysphagia and better captured significant dysphagia that would have otherwise been missed when the Bazaz score is used. EAT-10 and VHI-10 are better measures of postoperative dysphagia and dysphonia than the current metrics used in spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients [SEP] Cervical Vertebrae/surgery; Deglutition Disorders/etiology; Diskectomy/adverse effects; Dysphonia/etiology; Humans; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Postoperative Complications/etiology; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Spinal Fusion/adverse effects"
10	1	Comparison of the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D (SF-12) contemporaneous utility scores in patients with cardiovascular disease [SEP] PURPOSE: Multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs) are widely used to measure utility weights. This study sought to compare utility weights of two popular MAUIs, the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D, and inform researchers in the selection of generic MAUI for use with cardiovascular (CVD) patients. METHODS: Data were collected in the Young@Heart study, a randomised controlled trial of a nurse-led multidisciplinary home-based intervention compared to standard usual care Participants (n = 598) completed the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-12v2, from which the SF-6D can be constructed, at baseline and at 24-month follow-up. This study examined discrimination, responsiveness, correlation and differences across the two instruments. RESULTS: Both MAUIs were able to discriminate between the NYHA severity classes and recorded similar changes between the two time points although only SF-6D differences were significant. Correlations between the dimensions of the two MAUIs were low. There were significant differences between the two instruments in mild conditions but they were similar in severe conditions. Substantial ceiling and floor effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the EQ-5D and the SF-6D cover different spaces in health due to their classification systems. Both measures were capable of discriminating between severity groups and responsive to quality of life changes in the follow-up. It is recommended to use the EQ-5D-3L in severe and the SF-6D in mild CVD conditions [SEP] Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases/economics/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Utilization Review/methods; EQ-5D; QALY; SF-6D; Utility
11	1	Effects of preoperative obesity and psychiatric comorbidities on minimum clinically important differences for lumbar fusion in grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis: analysis from the prospective Quality Outcomes Database registry [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Medical comorbidities, particularly preoperatively diagnosed anxiety, depression, and obesity, may influence how patients perceive and measure clinical benefit after a surgical intervention. The current study was performed to define and compare the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity who underwent spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis METHODS: The Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients who underwent lumbar fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis during the period from January 2014 to August 2017. Collected patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), health status (EQ-5D), and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for back pain (NRS-BP) and leg pain (NRS-LP) Both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for MCID calculation were employed. RESULTS: Of 462 patients included in the prospective registry who underwent a decompression and fusion procedure, 356 patients (77.1%) had complete baseline and 12-month PRO data and were included in the study. The MCID values for ODI scores did not significantly differ in patients with and those without a preoperative diagnosis of obesity (20.58 and 20.69, respectively). In addition, the MCID values for ODI scores did not differ in patients with and without a preoperative diagnosis of anxiety or depression (24.72 and 22.56, respectively) Similarly, the threshold MCID values for NRS-BP, NRS-LP, and EQ-5D scores were not statistically different between all groups. Based on both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for determination of MCID thresholds, there were no statistically significant differences between all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: MCID thresholds were similar for ODI, EQ-5D, NRS-BP, and NRS-LP in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity undergoing spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis. Preoperative clinical and shared decision-making may be improved by understanding that preoperative medical comorbidities may not affect the way patients experience and assess important clinical changes postoperatively [SEP] BMI; ES = effect size; MCID; MCID = minimum clinically important difference; MDC = minimum detectable change; NASS = North American Spine Society; NRS = numeric rating scale; NRS-BP = NRS for back pain; NRS-LP = NRS for leg pain; ODI = Oswestry Disability Index; PD = psychiatric disease; PRO = patient-reported outcome; QOD; QOD = Quality Outcomes Database; Quality Outcomes Database; ROC = receiver operating characteristic; SCB = substantial clinical benefit; SEM = standard error of measurement; anxiety; degenerative; depression; fusion; lumbar spine; minimum clinically important difference; obesity; spondylolisthesis
12	1	The five-repetition sit-to-stand test: evaluation of a simple and objective tool for the assessment of degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Recently, objective functional tests have generated interest since they can supplement an objective dimension to clinical assessment. The five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test is a quick and objective tool that tests movements frequently used in everyday life. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 5R-STS test in patients with degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine. METHODS: Patients and healthy volunteers completed the standardized 5R-STS, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, and EQ-5D for health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To assess convergent validity, the 5R-STS test times were correlated with these questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 157 patients and 80 volunteers were enrolled Direct correlation with RMDQ (r = 0.49), ODI (r = 0.44), and VAS for back pain (r = 0.31) and indirect correlation with the EQ-5D index (r = -0.41) were observed (p < 0.001). The 5R-STS test showed no correlation with VAS for leg pain and EQ-5D VAS (p > 0.05). In 119 individuals, the 5R-STS test demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98. The upper limit of normal, distinguishing patients with and without objective functional impairment, was identified as 10.35 seconds. A severity stratification classified patients with test times of 10.5-15.2, 15.3-22.0, or greater than 22.0 seconds as having mild, moderate, or severe functional impairment, respectively CONCLUSIONS: The 5R-STS test is a simple and effective tool to describe objective functional impairment. A patient able to perform the test in 10.4 seconds can be considered to have no relevant objective functional impairment.

METHODS: Patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation were randomized to either a 12-week rehabilitation programme with education and physical training (intervention group) or standard care (control group). At baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months participants completed 5 different quality of life questionnaires (Quality of Life in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF-QoL-18), Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of Life (AFEQT), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D)), and physical exercise tests. Differences in mean] scores between groups were analysed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (age range 43-78 years, 31% female) were included. In the intervention group the AF-QoL-18 score increased from baseline (48.4 (standard deviation (SD) 22.8)) to 6 months (68.0 (SD 15.2)) compared with the control group (baseline 51.6 (SD 22.3), 6 months 59.2 (SD 27.3)). After 12 months, there was no difference. Similar patterns were found for the other questionnaires. Maximum exercise capacity improved in the intervention group from baseline (176 W (SD 48)) to 6 months (190 W (SD 55)). There was no change in the control group CONCLUSION: Education and physical training may have a short-term (but no long-term) beneficial effect on quality of life and physical exercise capacity in patients with atrial fibrillation [SEP] Adult; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation/physiopathology/psychology/therapy; Exercise Therapy/methods; Exercise Tolerance/physiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic/methods; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; atrial fibrillation; education; physical exercise; quality of life; rehabilitation

The emergence of smartphones facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and active real-time monitoring through time-stamped prompts; however there are few validated self-report measures designed for this purpose. METHODS: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom (MZ), embedded in a customised smart-phone application MZ asks participants to rate anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a 7-point Likert scale. For comparison, we used four standard clinical questionnaires administered to participants weekly to quantify mania (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (EQ-5D). We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline Personality Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study longitudinal (median±iqr: 313±194 days) variation and differences of mood traits by exploring the data using diverse time-series tools. RESULTS: MZ correlated well (|R|>0.5,p<0.0001) with QIDS, GAD-7, and EQ-5D. We found statistically strong (|R|>0.3,p<0.0001) differences in variability in all questionnaires for the three cohorts. Compared to HC, BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and variability, and on average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression, and anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ variability can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible using the weekly questionnaires. LIMITATIONS: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings. CONCLUSIONS: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily monitoring of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Anger; Anxiety/psychology; Bipolar Disorder/psychology; Borderline Personality Disorder/psychology; Depression/psychology; Female; Humans; Irritable Mood; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Self Report; Self-Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Bipolar disorder; Borderline personality disorder; Digital health; Mood assessment; Mood monitoring; Patient reported outcome measures

Despite a significant number of medical approaches and the creation of new drugs, the effectiveness of treatment remains unsatisfactory, which necessitates the creation of complex treatment programs. Pulse low-frequency magnetotherapy is a modern method that makes it possible to potentiate the therapeutic effects of chondroprotectors for transdermal administration using magnetophoresis technology. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy using chondroprotective magnetophoresis using 'running' pulsed magnetic field (RPMF) and application of chondroxide (transdermal gel form) in patients with knee OA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 65 patients with grade II - III knee OA according to the Kellgren-Lwrence classification. The 1st group included 25 patients who received local therapy - chondroxide magnetophoresis using RPMF (20 mT, frequency 6.25 Hz, exposure time 20 min, No. 12); in the 2nd group - 20 patients who underwent placebo-magnetotherapy of chondroxide; in the 3rd group - 20 patients who used RPMF without local chondroprotective therapy. We used VAS, WOMAC scales, EQ-5D questionnaire, OMERACT-OARSI criterion in order to analyze the results. RESULTS: A pronounced analgesic effect of the treatment was registered (according to the VAS and WOMAC scales) in patients receiving magnetotherapy (p<0.01). A significant improvement in functional parameters (according to WOMAC) was noted, more pronounced in patients who used chondroxide magnetophoresis (p<0.001). During the course of treatment, a positive effect of magnetotherapy on the indicators of quality of life (according to EQ-5D) was registered. A high percentage of response (68.1%) to therapy using magnetophoresis of the transdermal form of chondroxide (according to OMERACT-OARSI) was demonstrated. No adverse reactions were registered during treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of the local therapy method in the form of magnetophoresis of the transdermal form of the chondroxide is an effective and safe treatment technology that improves the functional state and quality of life of patients with OA of the knee joint [SEP] Administration, Cutaneous; Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Chondroitin Sulfates/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Gels; Humans; Magnetic Field Therapy; Osteoarthritis, Knee/drug therapy/therapy; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; chondroprotectors; chondroxide; magnetophoresis; osteoarthritis of the knee joint; pulsed magnetotherapy; running magnetic field; symptom-modifying drugs of slow action; transdermal forms

PURPOSE: To describe levels of self-efficacy, emotional distress, kinesiophobia, and widespread pain in a cohort with long-standing PFP and determine their association with measures of pain, function, and health-related quality of life. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Included were 112 patients with PFP (age range, 16-40 years) who had been recruited to a randomized controlled trial Seven baseline factors (patient sex, pain duration, number of pain sites throughout the body, kinesiophobia [Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia], emotional distress [Hopkins Symptom Checklist], self-efficacy, and knee extension strength) were investigated for associations with the following outcomes: symptoms of PFP (Anterior Knee Pain Scale), pain (worst and usual), and health-related quality of life (5-level EuroQol-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D-5L]). We used bivariate models and multivariable linear regression models with a stepwise backward removal method to find associations with the outcomes. Internal validation was conducted, and adjusted coefficients after shrinkage are presented. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 28% reported emotional distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist ≥1.75), 69% reported multiple pain sites, and 33% had widespread pain. The kinesiophobia score was elevated, with a mean score of 35.4 ± 8.2. Self-efficacy was strongly associated with better function (Anterior Knee Pain Scale) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) as well as lower pain scores in bivariate and multivariable models. Self-efficacy and emotional distress explained 50% of the variance in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). CONCLUSION: Our findings support other studies of PFP suggesting elevated levels of kinesiophobia and emotional distress and higher rates of widespread pain compared with the general population or pain-free controls. Higher self-efficacy was associated with better function and health-related quality of life. Together with emotional distress, it explained half the variance of health-related life quality. The results underline the importance of approaching these patients in a biopsychosocial model REGISTRATION: NCT02114294 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier) [SEP] knee; patellofemoral pain; psychological; self-efficacy; widespread pain
17	0	Health related quality of life aspects not captured by EQ-5D-5L: Results from an international survey of patients [SEP] BACKGROUND: In this paper we discuss and present evidence on whether a generic Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measurement tool, the EQ-5D-5L, captures the dimensions of quality of life (QoL) which patients consider significant METHODS: An online survey, of individuals with a chronic condition, mainly breast cancer (BC), blood cancers (BLC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), asthma, and rare diseases (RD) was conducted to collect data on HRQoL and important QoL aspects that respondents thought were not captured by the EQ-5D-5L. Patient organisations across 47 countries were invited to voluntarily share the survey tool with their membership network. RESULTS: 767 responses from 38 countries showed that important QoL aspects were not captured by EQ-5D-5L for 51% of respondents, including fatigue (19%) and medication side effects (12%), among others. Fatigue (17%) was also the most commonly reported QoL aspect that changed over the course of patients' illness, suggesting that the current version of the EQ-5D-5L might miss capturing significant clinical changes in important QoL domains CONCLUSIONS: Utilisation of the EQ-5D-5L in HRQoL measurement raises inconsistencies in capturing QoL attributes and changes in disease-specific patient populations. Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which other generic HRQoL measurement tools capture the aspects of health that really matter for patients [SEP] Adult; Chronic Disease/psychology; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Fatigue; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Cost utility analysis; EQ-5D-5L; Health technology assessment; Patient preferences; QALY; QoL utilities
18	1	Patient-reported outcomes of symptom burden in patients receiving surgical or nonsurgical treatment for low-intermediate risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: A comparative analysis of a prospective registry [SEP] PURPOSE: To explore treatment-related changes in symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) patients treated surgically and non-surgically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC treated at the Head and Neck Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were recruited to a prospective registry study between 2014 and 2016 and completed the core, head and neck-specific, and symptom interference sections of the MD Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI) multi-symptom questionnaire and the EQ-5D health status assessment as a measure of QOL at four time points. RESULTS: Longitudinal improvements from post-treatment nadir were observed across all groups. For patients treated with single modality, symptom interference, but not core and head and neck specific, MDASI scores were significantly better at 6 months in patients treated with surgery than radiation (P = 0.04). For patients treated with multiple modalities, scores for each of the three domains (i.e., core, head and neck -specific, and interference MDASI) were significantly better in the surgical group than the nonsurgical group at treatment completion (P = 0.0003, P = 0.0006 and P = 0.02) and 6 weeks (P = 0.001, P = 0.05 and P = 0.04), but not 6 months (P = 0.11, P = 0.16 and P = 0.040). No significant differences in EQ5D health status were observed between groups at any time point, reflecting similar overall QOL in all groups. CONCLUSION: Symptom burden and QOL improves after treatment in OPSCC survivors over time regardless of whether primary surgical or nonsurgical treatment is used, although acute symptom profiles may differ [SEP] Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/therapy; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/therapy; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Registries; MDASI; Oropharyngeal cancer; Patient reported outcomes; Radiation; Transoral robotic surgery
19	1	A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Comprehensive Smoking-Cessation Interventions Based on the Community and Hospital Collaboration [SEP] BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cigarette smoking in China is high and the utilization of smoking cessation clinics is very low. Multicomponent smoking cessation interventions involving community and hospital collaboration have the potential to increase the smoking cessation rate. However, the cost-effectiveness of this intervention model is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a smoking cessation intervention trial in 19 community health service centers in Beijing, China. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective to compare three strategies of smoking cessation: no intervention (NI), pharmacological intervention (PI), and comprehensive intervention (CI) (PI plus online health promotion). A Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 years, was used to simulate the natural progression of estimated 10,000 male smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to obtain data on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by using the five-level EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore parameters of uncertainty in the model. RESULTS: A total of 680 participants were included in this study, including 283 in the PI group and 397 in the CI group. After 6 months of follow-up, the smoking cessation rate reached 30.0% in the CI group and 21.2% in the PI group. Using the Markov model, compared with the NI group, the intervention strategies of the PI group and the CI group were found to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $535.62/QALY and $366.19/QALY, respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the CI strategy was always the most cost-effective intervention. CONCLUSION: CI for smoking cessation, based in hospital and community in China, is more cost-effective than PI alone. Therefore, this smoking cessation model should be considered to be implemented in healthcare settings [SEP] Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Smoking/epidemiology; Smoking Cessation/methods; community health centers; cost-effectiveness; online health promotion; pharmacological intervention; smoking cessation

METHODS: The internal consistency reliability is measured by Cronbach's α coefficient and the structural validity is measured by factor analysis. The difference in health utility value of different characteristic populations is compared by t test and analysis of variance RESULTS: Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.857. Exploratory factor analysis extracts two common factors whose cumulative contribution rate is 77.311%. The first common factor represents mobility, self-care and uaual activities. The second common factor represents pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that the correlation of the two common factors was 0.659, the average variance of the first common factor was 0.862 and the combination reliability was 0.949, and the average variance extracted of the second common factor was 0.587 and the composite reliability was 0.739. The factor loadings for mobility, self-care and uaual activities on the first common factor were 0.871, 0.945 and 0.967, respectively. The loadings for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression on the second common factor were 0.708 and 0.820, respectively. CONCLUSION: EQ-5D-5L has good reliability and validity when it is applied to the measurement of healthy life quality of residents in Southwest China [SEP] Anxiety/diagnosis; China; Depression/diagnosis; Health Status; Humans; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; EQ-5D-5L; Reliability; Validity
21	0	Cluster randomised control trial of the effect on attendance and outcomes of multi-disciplinary teams involving psychologists during pelvic floor muscle training for pelvic floor dysfunction [SEP] Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective, acceptable to patients, and cost efficient as a treatment for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). However, PFMT outcomes are mediated by patient variables, such as depression, anxiety, motivation, and health values. The current study examined whether multi-disciplinary provision of PFMT involving a psychologist would improve attendance and outcomes (Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02549157). 88 consecutively referred patients (age 28 - 85 years), with a variety of PFD, were randomised into two groups: PFMT treatment as usual (n = 47), and PFMT with a psychologist involved (n = 41). Patients received 6-month out-patient physiotherapy. More patients with the psychologist completed the course, and there were significantly greater improvements in subjective symptoms (Queensland scale), quality of life (EQ-5D), and anxiety (HADS), although not in objective measures (Oxford Grading) or depression (HADS). These results suggest that an MDT including a psychologist during PFMT intervention treatment may help some patients.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective, acceptable to patients, and cost efficient as a treatment for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). However, PFMT outcomes are mediated by patient variables, such as depression, anxiety, motivation, and health values. The effectiveness of a multi-disciplinary team delivering both PFMT and psychological support simultaneously to women undergoing PFMT for PFD is unknown.What do the results of this study add? Psychological support delivered alongside PFMT increased patient attendance, improved subjective ratings of pelvic floor functioning, health-related quality of life, and reduced anxiety This is one of the first demonstrations that this can be achieved through a multi-disciplinary team delivering their support simultaneously to the patients.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Improving subjective functioning and reducing attrition rates in PFD patients has cost implications in terms of reduced need for surgery, and making future surgery more effective. The inclusion of brief, easily delivered psychological support, integrated into the PFMT sessions in a multidisciplinary way may represent an extremely cost effective method of improving the service for these patients [SEP] Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pelvic Floor; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; Pelvic floor dysfunction; attendance; clinical outcomes; pelvic floor muscle training; psychological support
22	1	Characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain syndromes screened by the painDETECT questionnaire and diagnosed by physician exam [SEP] BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics, treatment usage, and health outcomes of US adults diagnosed with neuropathic pain (NeP) by experienced physicians. METHODS: Adults with scores exceeding the threshold for probable NeP (painDETECT ≥19) and diagnosed with NeP by a qualified physician completed a questionnaire that included comorbid conditions, pain symptoms and experiences, medication use, health status (3-level EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L]: health utilities index and visual analog scale), pain severity and interference with functioning (Brief Pain Inventory), and work and activity impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire) Descriptive analyses were performed for each NeP subtype. RESULTS: Participants (n=295) were predominantly female (64.4%), middle-aged (53.9%), and white (51.5%). Chronic low back pain was the most frequently diagnosed major NeP syndrome (n=166), followed by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (n=58), post-trauma neuropathy (n=47), post-surgical neuropathy (n=28), and central NeP (n=23). An additional 45 participants were diagnosed, but did not meet the criteria for the aforementioned subtypes. Participants could be diagnosed with multiple subtypes Across each NeP subtype, patients reported high rates of comorbid disease, including arthritis (range: 39.1%-64.3%) and high blood pressure (range: 26.1%-69.0%), as well as symptomology that included numbness (range: 68.1%-91.4%) and changes in muscular strength (range: 24.1%-65.2%). The majority of patients reported back pain (range: 77.8%-95.7%) and arthritis/joint pain (range: 68.1%-78.6%). The most commonly reported types of NeP pain medication were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (range: 43.1%-70.2%), weak opioids (range: 22.2%-39.3%), and strong opioids (range: 8.7%-28.6%). All six NeP groups generally reported similar levels of dysfunction on all self-report measures. The most notable finding was that the EuroQol-5D-3L health utilities index scores for each of the six groups were lower than the US norms by a clinically important amount. CONCLUSION: These exploratory findings indicate that patients with NeP across different etiologies are medically complex and experience impaired function across multiple domains [SEP] activity impairment; functional status; health-related quality of life; neuropathic pain; pain medication use; physician diagnosis; work impairment
23	1	A matched comparison of the patient-reported outcome measures of cemented and cementless total knee replacements, based on the National Joint Registry of England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Isle of Man and England's National PROM collection programme [SEP] Background and purpose - Total knee replacement (TKR) can be implanted with or without bone cement. It is currently unknown how the functional outcomes compare Therefore, we compared the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) of both fixation methods. Patients and methods - We performed a propensitymatched comparison of 14,404 TKRs (7,202 cemented and 7,202 cementless) enrolled in the National Joint Registry and the English National PROMs collection programme Subgroup analyses were performed in different age groups (1) < 55 years; (2) 55-64 years; (3) 65-74 years; (4) ≥ 75 years. Results - The 6-month postoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for cemented TKR (35, SD 9.7) than cementless TKR (34, SD 9.9). The OKS was also significantly higher for the cemented TKR in all age groups, except the 55-64-year group. A significantly higher proportion of cemented TKRs had an excellent OKS (≥ 41) compared with cementless (32% vs. 28%, p < 0.001) and a lower proportion of poor (< 27) scores (19% vs. 22%, p = 0.001). This was also observed for all age subgroups. There were no significant differences in EQ-5D points gained postoperatively between the groups respectively (0.31 vs. 0.30, p = 0.1) Interpretation - Cemented TKRs had a greater proportion of excellent OKS scores and lower proportion of poor scores both overall and across all age groups However, the absolute differences are small and below the minimally clinically important difference, making both fixation types acceptable. Currently the vast majority of TKRs are cemented and the results from this study suggest that this is appropriate [SEP] Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/methods; England/epidemiology; Humans; Knee Prosthesis; Middle Aged; Northern Ireland/epidemiology; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Registries; Treatment Outcome; Wales
24	1	The Cost Effectiveness of Docetaxel and Active Symptom Control versus Active Symptom Control Alone for Refractory Oesophagogastric Adenocarcinoma: Economic Analysis of the COUGAR-02 Trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: The COUGAR-02 trial recently showed survival and quality-of-life benefits of docetaxel and active symptom control (DXL + ASC) over active symptom control (ASC) alone in patients with refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation conforming to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DXL + ASC versus ASC from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were conducted using trial data. Utility values were captured using the EQ-5D completed by patients at 3- and 6-weekly intervals, while resource use was captured using nurse-completed report forms and patient reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and the main outcome was cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture sampling uncertainty and to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The analysis horizon was the trial period (median follow-up 12 months) and no modelling or discounting of future costs and benefits was conducted. RESULTS: Average costs were £9352 and £6218 for DXL + ASC and ASC, respectively, and average QALYs were 0.302 and 0.186, respectively. This yielded an ICER of £27,180 for DXL + ASC. DXL + ASC had a 24 % chance of being cost effective at a £20,000 QALY threshold (lambda) and a mean net monetary benefit of -£821; this rose to 59 % and £332 when the threshold was raised to £30,000. If NICE end-of-life criteria are applied, the probability of cost effectiveness increases to 90 % (at lambda = £50,000). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: DXL + ASC is likely to be cost effective if an end-of-life premium is applied. Further research should determine the impact of different utility measurement strategies and different chemotherapy delivery modes on estimates of cost effectiveness [SEP] Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/economics; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Docetaxel; Esophageal Neoplasms/drug therapy/economics; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/economics; Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Taxoids/therapeutic use

Methods: A total of 92 elderly patients with femoral neck fracture who received hemiarthroplasty from July 2018 to December 2018 in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were enrolled in this study. The average age of the participants was (75±6) years, including 31 males and 61 females, and 72(78.3%) of the patients complicated with comorbidity According to the perioperative management method, the patients were divided into the observational group (47 cases with ERAS) and the control group (45 cases with normal management). The data related to operation, hospitalization, complication and nursing satisfaction were compared between the 2 groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation. The Harris scores for hip joint and EQ-5D index scores were applied to evaluate the clinical outcomes. The follow-up were performed periodically for 3 months. The measurement data in accordance with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were compared with t test Results: All the surgeries completed successfully and no patient died during perioperative period. Compared with the control group, the operation rate in 48 hours (χ(2)=17.781, P<0.01), bed days (Z=-4.987, P<0.01), and medical costs (Z=-4.315, P<0.01) favored that in the observational group. The incidence of complication and nursing satisfaction showed no significant difference between the two groups (31.1% vs 14.9%, 86.7% vs 95.7%, χ(2)=3.432, 1.380, both P>0.05) The perioperative VAS score was lower in the observational group. The Harris scores were higher in the observational group after 1 months (t=4.458, P<0.01), however the quality of life for 2 groups was similar at all time points (t=1.293, 1.227, both P>0.05).

26	1	The use of pre-operative virtual reality to reduce anxiety in women undergoing gynecological surgeries: a prospective cohort study [SEP] BACKGROUND: Pre-operative anxiety is common and is associated with negative surgical outcomes. Virtual reality (VR) is a promising new technology that offers opportunities to modulate patient experience and cognition and has been shown to be associated with lower levels of anxiety. In this study, we investigated changes in pre-operative anxiety levels before and after using VR in patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective minor gynecological surgeries in KK Women's and Children's hospital, Singapore were recruited. The VR intervention consisted of 10-min exposure via a headset loaded with sceneries, background meditation music and breathing exercises. For the primary outcome of pre-operative anxiety, patients were assessed at pre- and post-intervention using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Secondary outcomes of self-reported satisfaction scores and EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) were also collected. RESULTS: Data analysis from 108 patients revealed that HADS anxiety scores were significantly reduced from 7.2 ± 3.3 pre-intervention to 4.6 ± 3.0 post-intervention (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, HADS depression scores were significantly reduced from 4.7 ± 3.3 pre-intervention to 2.9 ± 2.5 post-intervention (p < 0.0001). Eighty-two percent of the patients self-reported VR intervention as 'Good' or 'Excellent'. EQ-5D-3L showed significant changes in dimensions of 'usual activities' (p = 0.025), 'pain/discomfort' (p = 0.008) and 'anxiety/ depression' (p < 0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing minor gynecological procedures, the VR intervention brought about a significant reduction in pre-operative anxiety. This finding may be clinically important to benefit patients with high pre-operative anxiety without the use of anxiolytics.

METHOD: The original English form was translated according to guidelines. We included patients with ACL injury undergoing reconstruction in two centers over 3 years. Subjects completed the translated MARS, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form and EuroQol EQ5D. The examining physician completed the Tegner Lysholm scale as an objective evaluation. Re-testing was obtained after one month. We used Spearman`s correlation to evaluate construct validity and reproducibility, Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency and intraclass correlation for test-retest reliability RESULTS: We collected valid forms from 99 patients (32.1 ± 8.8 years, 64.6% males) during the preoperative evaluation and 45 were re-tested. Significant, very good correlations were found between the MARS and Tegner Lysholm (Spearman's r = 0.712, p < 0.0001) and IKDC (Spearman's r = 0.801, p < 0.0001). Cronbach's alpha was 0.893 at the initial completion and 0.799 at re-test. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.895. CONCLUSIONS: The Romanian-translated MARS is a valid, consistent and reliable physical activity outcome measure in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [SEP] Marx activity rating scale; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction/rehabilitation; athletic injuries; health care; outcome assessment
28	1	Focused Shockwave Treatment for Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a condition of lateral hip pain. Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS. METHODS: This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: F-ESWT in association with a specific exercise program is safe and effective for GTPS, with a success rate of 86.8% at 2 months after treatment, which was maintained until the end of follow-up.

29	1	The frequency of remission and low disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and their ability to identify people with low disability and normal quality of life [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Treat-to-target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommends targeting remission, with low disease activity (LDA) being an alternative goal. When deciding to target remission or LDA, important considerations are the likelihood of attaining them, and their impacts on function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We have addressed this by studying: (a) the frequency of remission and LDA/remission; (b) DAS28-ESR trends after remission; (c) ability of remission vs. LDA to identify patients with normal function (HAQ ≤ 0.5) and HRQoL (EQ-5D ≥ the normal population). METHODS: We studied 571 patients in two clinical trials, and 1693 patients in a 10-year routine care cohort. We assessed the frequency and sustainability of remission and LDA/remission, variability in DAS28-ESR after remission, and sensitivity/specificity of remission and LDA/remission at identifying patients with low disability levels and normal HRQoL using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Point remission and remission/LDA were common (achieved by 35-58% and 49-74% of patients, respectively), but were rarely sustained (sustained remission and remission/LDA achieved by 5-9% and 9-16% of patients, respectively). Following attaining remission, DAS28-ESR levels varied substantially. Despite this, of those patients attaining point remission, the majority (53-61%) were in remission at study end-points. Whilst remission was highly specific at identifying patients with low disability (85-91%) it lacked sensitivity (51-57%); similar findings were seen for normal HRQoL (specificity 78-86%; sensitivity 52-59%). The optimal DAS28-cut-off to identify individuals with low disability and normal HRQoL was around the LDA threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support both the treat-to-target goals. Attaining remission is highly specific for attaining low disability and normal HRQoL, although many patients with more active disease also have good function and HRQoL. Attaining a DAS28-ESR ≤ 3.2 has a better balance of specificity and sensitivity for attaining these outcomes, with the benefit of being more readily achievable. Although sustaining these targets over time is rare, even attaining them on a one-off basis leads to better function and HRQoL outcomes for patients [SEP] Adult; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents/therapeutic use; Arthritis, Rheumatoid/diagnosis/drug therapy; Disability Evaluation; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Remission Induction; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Function; Health-related quality of life; Rheumatoid arthritis; Treatment targets
30	0	Perception of Menstrual Normality and Abnormality in Spanish Female Nursing Students [SEP] Menstrual problems are usually taboo; and often, some, such as dysmenorrhea, are presumed normal. This study seeks to compare the menstrual characteristics and symptoms of female university students reporting self-perceived normality concerning their cycles and menstruation with those who perceive their menstruation as being abnormal. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 270 nursing students using a self-report questionnaire that included sociodemographic and gynecological issues, together with Visual Analog Scale, the Andersch and Milsom Scale, and the Spanish version of the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EuroQol-5D) to measure self-perceived health status. A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, linear trend chi-square, and Student's t-test, and a multivariate analysis of stepwise binary logistic regression was performed to predict the perception of cycle abnormality. In total, 77.4% of participants displayed normality; however, in self-reporting of menstrual characteristics, 67.4% identified alterations. Young women suffering from menstrual dizziness were 1.997 (CI95% = 1.010-3.950; p = 0.047) more likely to manifest abnormal menstruation, 4.518 (CI95% = 1.239-16.477; p = 0.022) more likely if they suffered from Grade 3 menstrual pain, and 2.851 (CI95% = 1.399-5.809; p = 0.004) more likely if they perceived that menstruation interfered with their daily lives. Many menstrual changes and symptoms are still considered normal, making it difficult to identify and address these issues Therefore, it is necessary to develop health policies and strategies to improve menstrual health literacy for increased knowledge and earlier diagnosis [SEP] Cross-Sectional Studies; Dysmenorrhea; Female; Health; Humans; Menstruation; Prevalence; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; disorders menstrual; menstrual experiences; menstrual health

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ECT in ulcerated vs. non-ulcerated tumors and investigate the effect on tumor-associated symptoms. METHODS: Twenty cancer centers in the International Network for Sharing Practices on Electrochemotherapy (InspECT) prospectively collected data. ECT was performed following ESOPE protocol. Response was evaluated by lesion size development. Pain, symptoms, performance status (ECOG-Index) and health status (EQ-5D questionnaire) were evaluated. RESULTS: 716 patients with ulcerated (n = 302) and non-ulcerated (n = 414) cutaneous tumors and metastases were included (minimum follow-up of 45 days). Non-ulcerated lesions responded to ECT better than ulcerated lesions (complete response 65 % vs. 51 %, p = 0.0061). Only 38 % (115/302) with ulcerated lesions before ECT presented with ulcerated lesions at final follow-up. Patients with ulcerated lesions reported higher pain and more severe symptoms compared to non-ulcerated lesions, which significantly and continuously improved following ECT. In non-ulcerated lesions however, pain spiked during the treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: ECT is a safe and effective local treatment for cutaneous tumors. While ECT improves symptoms especially in patients with ulcerated lesions, data suggest the implementation of a perioperative pain management in non-ulcerated lesions during ECT [SEP] Bleomycin/adverse effects; Electrochemotherapy/adverse effects/methods; Humans; Pain/etiology; Prospective Studies; Skin Neoplasms/pathology; Treatment Outcome

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 117 symptomatic outpatients with HFpEF were prospectively enrolled in Germany, England, and Slovenia as part of the Studies Investigating Co-morbidities Aggravating Heart Failure (SICA-HF). Appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) mass (the sum of muscle mass in both arms and legs) was assessed by DEXA Echocardiography, 6-minute walk testing (6-MWT), muscle strength assessment, spiroergometry and QoL evaluation using EQ-5D Questionnaire were performed Sarcopenia was defined as ASM 2 standard deviations below the mean of a healthy reference group aged 18-40years. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the E/e' value: ≤8, 9-14, and ≥15. Sarcopenia was detected in 19.7% of all patients. These patients performed worse during 6-MWT (404±116 vs. 307±145m, p=0.003) and showed lower absolute peak oxygen consumption (1579±474 vs 1211±442mL/min, p<0.05). Both ASM and muscle strength were lowest in patients with E/e' >15 (p<0.05). Higher values of muscle strength/ASM were associated with a better QoL (r=0.5, p<0.0005). Logistic regression showed ASM to be independently associated with reduced distance walked during the 6-MWT adjusted for NYHA, height, left atrium diameter, ferritin and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) (odds ratio 1.2, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia affects a clinically relevant proportion of patients with HFpEF. Low ASM is strongly linked to reduced muscle strength, exercise capacity and QoL in these patients [SEP] Aged; Comorbidity; Echocardiography/methods; Europe/epidemiology; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Oxygen Consumption; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Sarcopenia/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology; Severity of Illness Index; Walk Test/methods; Exercise capacity; Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; Muscle wasting; Quality of life; Sarcopenia

[SEP] BACKGROUND: Targeted intervention for subgroups is a promising approach for the management of patellofemoral pain. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment designed according to subgroups will improve clinical outcomes in patients unresponsive to multimodal treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective crossover intervention. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP; n = 61; mean age, 27 ± 9 years) were enrolled. Patients with PFP received standard multimodal treatment 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Patients not responding to multimodal treatment were then classified into 1 of 3 subgroups (strong, weak and tight, and weak and pronated foot) using 6 simple clinical tests. They were subsequently administered 6 further weeks of targeted intervention, designed according to subgroup characteristics. Visual analog scale (VAS), perception of recovery scale (PRS), 5-Level European Quality 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L), and self-reported version of the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs scale (S-LANSS) were used to assess pain, knee function, and quality of life before and after the interventions. RESULTS: In total, 34% (n = 21) of patients demonstrated recovery after multimodal treatment. However, over 70% (n = 29/40) of nonresponders demonstrated recovery after targeted treatment. The VAS, PRS, S-LANSS, and EQ-5D-5L scores improved significantly after targeted intervention compared with after multimodal treatment (P < 0.001). The VAS score at rest was significantly lower in the ""weak and pronated foot"" and the ""weak and tight"" subgroups (P = 0.011 and P = 0.008, respectively). Posttreatment pain intensity on activity was significantly lower in the ""strong"" subgroup (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Targeted treatment designed according to subgroup characteristics improves clinical outcomes in patients unresponsive to multimodal treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Targeted intervention could be easily implemented after 6 simple clinical assessment tests to subgroup patients into 1 of 3 subgroups (strong, weak and tight, and weak and pronated foot). Targeted interventions applied according to the characteristics of these subgroups have more beneficial treatment effects than a current multimodal treatment program [SEP] Adult; Braces; Clinical Protocols; Combined Modality Therapy; Cross-Over Studies; Exercise Therapy/methods; Foot Orthoses; Humans; Muscle Strength; Muscle Stretching Exercises; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome/classification/therapy; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; Young Adult; knee injuries; pain perception; patella; rehabilitation; treatment outcome"
34	0	Review of total hip arthroplasty in patients younger than 30 years: mid- to long-term results [SEP] BACKGROUND: Data on the outcome of THA in patients under the age of 30 years is sparse. There is a perceived reluctance to offer surgery to young patients on the basis of potential early failure of the implant. The aim of this study was to review clinical and radiological outcomes of THA in patients under the age of 30 years in a high-volume specialist arthroplasty unit. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients between 1989 and 2009 was undertaken. 95 patients (118 THAs) were identified but 17 patients were excluded for lack of clinical records or for follow-up under 5 years. Clinical records were reviewed for demographics, underlying pathology, details of operation and failures. Radiographs were reviewed for evidence of loosening and wear of the components. Functional assessment was carried out using the modified Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Oxford Hip Score and EQ-5D-5L. RESULTS: Mean age was 25 (16-30) years and 65% patients were females. The most common underlying pathologies were development dysplasia of the hip (29%) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (25%) Mean follow-up was 12.6 (5-24) years, during which 19 patients (25%) were revised. The majority of the revisions were for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons are cautious when considering THA in very young patients despite the significant documented improvement in function and quality of life after THA. This study reports on the mid- to long-term results of THA which will be valuable when advising young patients on the prospects of revision surgery at the time of primary THA [SEP] Adult; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/adverse effects; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure; Quality of Life; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; <30 years; Hip arthroplasty; very young patients
35	1	[The effect of multimorbidity on functional and quality of life outcomes in women with generalized osteoarthritis] [SEP] INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) as the most common joint disease is a major public health concern. AIM: To investigate the effect of multimorbidity on functional and quality of life outcomes in women with generalized osteoathritis (hand and knee arthritis, GOA). METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, patients according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for OA were invited. The control group consisted of subjects without any musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoarthritis or inflammatory rheumatic disease. Comorbidity count was calculated from the investigated comorbidities. In the GOA group, the function was assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Cochin Hand Scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), while quality of life was measured in both groups with the EuroQol-5D Scale. Interaction between summarized comorbidity count, age, body mass index (BMI) and scores were analysed. Descriptive statistics, two-sample t-test and Pearson's correlation test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The study groups included 200-200 participants with a similar age spread. Significant correlation was demonstrated in both study groups between higher comorbidity count and older age (0.37, p<0.001, and 0.24, p<0.001 in the GOA and the control group, respectively) and higher BMI (0.18, p: 0.01, and 0.45, p<0.001 in the GOA and the control group, respectively). In GOA, the increasing comorbidity number had a negative effect on the measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Age and BMI showed strong correlation with multimorbidity in both groups. The lower correlation between BMI and comorbidity count in the GOA group requires further investigation and may suggest different interactions.

36	0	Stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion in the treatment of refractory trigeminal neuropathy [SEP] OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effectiveness of a custom-made neurostimulator with which to treat patients for refractory trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) at the level of the Gasserian ganglion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 22 patients referred to our pain clinic, AZ Sint-Nikolaas, between 2010 and 2015, was conducted using the McGill Pain and EuroQoL questionnaire before, two weeks after, and at the final follow-up after neurostimulator treatment. RESULTS: Successful test stimulations were achieved for 77.3% of patients, with satisfactory long-term pain relief reported by 44% at 24 months. The predictive value of the trial stimulation was 80%, with 82.4% of patients reporting one or more complication, the most common being neck discomfort due to fibrosis. A small cohort size (22) limited our statistical analyses. However younger patients presented with a higher incidence of negative results after 24 months or physical complications. Cut-off ages were set at the age of 62 and 58 years respectively CONCLUSION: Stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion is a promising technique for the treatment of refractory TNP and should be considered ahead of more invasive techniques such as motor cortex or deep brain stimulation. The referral of refractory TNP patients should also be accomplished as early as possible to improve outcome [SEP] Adult; Aged; Electric Stimulation Therapy/methods; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Management/methods; Retrospective Studies; Trigeminal Ganglion/physiology; Trigeminal Nerve Diseases/therapy; Gasserian ganglion; Intractable pain; Neurostimulation; Persistent postoperative pain; Trigeminal neuropathic pain

The analyses of data from the REVASCAT trial proved that stent thrombectomy improves post-morbid wiring test outcomes in patients with AIS compared with drug therapy. However, few studies focus on the relationship between cognitive impairment and functional outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. METHODS: A total of 647 participants registered from stroke centers. Stroke severity was evaluated by National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS). The functional status was estimated by modified Rankin scale (mRS). The cognitive impairment was assessed by trained neurologists at 14 (±4) and 90 (±7) days after stroke onset using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A MoCA score of less than 26 was considered post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). RESULTS: A total of 120 Patients who underwent endovascular therapy were included. The PSCI group had higher levels of age, men, educational status, atrial fibrillation, smoking, alcoholism, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score of the anterior circulation, and OTP time than the non-PSCI group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the 14-day MoCA score, 14-day NIHSS score, 3-month MoCA score, 3-month NIHSS score, 3-month mRS score, and 3-month EQ5D score were lower in those PSCI patients. The risk predictors of PSCI were age, sex, educational level, atrial fibrillation, smoking, alcoholism, ASPECT Score (anterior circulation), 14-day MoCA score, and 14-day NIHSS score There were strong relationships between 3-month NIHSS and MoCA (r = -0.483, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that 14-day MoCA score, memory, abstraction, visuospatial/executive functions, attention, and language, played a significant role to predict PSCI [area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7]. It had predictive value for the 14-day visuospatial/executive functions to predict 3-month functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early application of the MoCA in different cognitive regions could predict the PSCI and future functional outcomes, which is necessary to screen high-risk patients with poor prognosis and conduct an early intervention [SEP] MoCA; endovascular therapy; functional outcome; post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI); risk factors
38	0	Mental Health Burden of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Germany: Predictors of Mental Health Impairment [SEP] INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is causing an enormous psychological burden for most people. This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Fear/psychology; Female; Germany/epidemiology; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/psychology; Risk Factors; Young Adult; COVID-19; anxiety; changes in mental health; depression; mental health; predictors of change
39	1	The impact of loneliness and social isolation on health state utility values: a systematic literature review [SEP] BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation are recognised as social problems and denote a significant health burden. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to explore the health state utility values (HSUVs) associated with loneliness and/or social isolation. METHOD: Peer-reviewed journals published in English language that reported both HSUVs along with loneliness and/or social isolation scores were identified through five databases No restrictions were made relating to the population, study design or utility estimation method used. RESULTS: In total, 19 papers were included; 12 included a measure of loneliness, four studies included a measure of social isolation and three studies considered both loneliness and social isolation. All studies focused on individuals with pre-existing health conditions-where the EQ-5D-3L instrument was most frequently used to assess HSUVs. HSUVs ranged from 0.5 to 0.95 in those who reported not being lonely, 0.42 to 0.97 in those who experienced some level of loneliness, 0.3 to 0.87 in those who were socially isolated and 0.63 to 0.94 in those who were not socially isolated. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in HSUVs complicated by the presence of co-morbidities, population heterogeneity, variations in methods used to derive utility scores and differences in the measurement of loneliness and/or social isolation. Nevertheless, the lower HSUVs observed should be considered to significantly impact quality of life, though we also note the need for further research to explore the unique impact of loneliness and social isolation on HSUVs that can be used in the future economic evaluations [SEP] Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Loneliness; Quality of Life/psychology; Social Isolation; Economic burden; Health burden; Health state utility values; Loneliness; Social isolation
40	1	Assessment of 1-year Outcomes in Survivors of Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation or Mechanical Ventilation: A Prospective Observational Study [SEP] BACKGROUND: Little is known about the long-term outcomes of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This study aimed to investigate the 1-year outcomes of these patients or patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) and compare their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to the general population. METHODS: Severe ARDS survivors admitted to two ICUs in China between January 2012 and January 2014 were enrolled. Of the severe ARDS survivors enrolled, 1-year postdischarge, HRQoL assessment using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol questionnaire dimensions, 6-min walking distance, chest computed tomography scan, pulmonary function, and arterial blood gas analysis were compared for ARDS patients with or without ECMO. RESULTS: ARDS patients receiving ECMO had a significantly higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (30.3 ± 6.7 vs. 26.5 ± 7.3, P= 0.036), lung injury score (3.3 ± 0.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.5, P= 0.000), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (10.8 ± 3.5 vs. 7.9 ± 3.1, P= 0.000), lower PaO2/FiO2ratio ([mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa], 68.3 ± 16.1 vs. 84.8 ± 16.5, P= 0.000), and increased extrapulmonary organ failure (2 [1, 3] vs. 1 [1, 1], P= 0.025) compared with patients not receiving ECMO. ECMO and non-ECMO survivors showed similar pulmonary function, morphological abnormalities, resting arterial blood gas values, and 6-min walking distance. Mild pulmonary dysfunction and abnormal morphology were observed in a few survivors. In addition, ECMO and non-ECMO survivors showed a similar quality of life. ECMO survivors showed lower SF-36 physical functioning and role-physical domain scores (minimum clinically significant difference at least 5 points), and non-ECMO survivors had similar outcome. CONCLUSIONS: One-year posthospital discharge, severe ARDS survivors receiving ECMO or MV demonstrated comparable outcomes. Compared with the general population, ARDS survivors showed reduced HRQoL. Pulmonary function and lung morphology revealed sufficient recovery with minor lung impairment [SEP] Adult; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/methods; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Respiration, Artificial/methods; Respiratory Distress Syndrome/mortality/therapy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult

METHODS: Patients meeting Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axSpA, but not modified New York radiographic criteria, received double-blind ETN 50 mg/week or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks, then open-label ETN (ETN/ETN or PBO/ETN). Clinical, health, productivity, MRI and safety outcomes were assessed and the 48-week data are presented here. RESULTS: 208/225 patients (92%) entered the open-label phase at week 12 (ETN, n=102; PBO, n=106). The percentage of patients achieving ASAS40 increased from 33% to 52% between weeks 12 and 48 for ETN/ETN and from 15% to 53% for PBO/ETN (within-group p value <0.001 for both). For ETN/ETN and PBO/ETN, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions utility score improved by 0.14 and 0.08, respectively, between baseline and week 12 and by 0.23 and 0.22 between baseline and week 48 Between weeks 12 and 48, MRI Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada sacroiliac joint (SIJ) scores decreased by -1.1 for ETN/ETN and by -3.0 for PBO/ETN, p<0.001 for both. Decreases in MRI SIJ inflammation and C-reactive protein correlated with several clinical outcomes at weeks 12 and 48 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early active nr-axSpA demonstrated improvement from week 12 in clinical, health, productivity and MRI outcomes that was sustained to 48 weeks.

42	1	"Patients' Global Impression of Change in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain: Clinical relevance and correlations in daily practice [SEP] BACKGROUND: Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments have been developed to evaluate pain management in daily practice; the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) is particularly recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials. The prospective non-interventional multicenter PRO-QURE study aimed at assessing correlations between PGIC and pain measurements and treatment effects in patients followed in French pain centres. METHODS: Respectively, 495 and 379 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain initiating treatment with capsaicin 8% cutaneous patch(es) (female, 62.6%; mean age, 54.0 ± 14.8 years; post-surgical or traumatic pain, 52.7%; mean pain duration, 42.2 ± 54.1 months; DN4 score >4, 92.9%) completed the PGIC and several other PRO instruments before (baseline) and 3 months (M3) after treatment application. RESULTS: At M3, improvement (""much improved"" or ""very much improved"") was observed in 23.0% of patients, associated with decreases of -3.0 ± 2.2, -2.5 ± 2.4, and -23.1 ± 19.7 in BPI pain intensity, BPI pain interference and NPSI total scores, respectively. The highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with PGIC were found for pain intensity (BPI: r = -0.479, p < 0.001), satisfaction with current state (Patient Acceptable Symptomatic State: r = 0.455, p < 0.001), and treatment effectiveness (TSQM: r = 0.431, p < 0.001); correlation coefficients were lower for all NPSI scores, BPI pain interference score, HAD scores and EQ-5D-3L index. CONCLUSIONS: In daily clinical practice, significant improvement in peripheral neuropathic pain, as assessed by PGIC scores, significantly correlated with changes in well-established measures of pain intensity, pain interference with activities of daily living, mood and quality of life, confirming its clinical interest as PRO measure in real-world conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinically important improvement in peripheral neuropathic pain, as assessed by PGIC scores, significantly correlated with well-established measures of pain intensity, pain interference in daily life and treatment efficacy. This result, associated with the ease of administration and scoring, encourages the widespread use of the PGIC in daily practice [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Analgesics/therapeutic use; Capsaicin/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia/drug therapy/psychology; Pain Clinics; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Transdermal Patch; Treatment Outcome; capsaicin; patient-reported outcome measures; patients’ global impression of change; peripheral neuropathic pain"

When still able to cook older adults often hold some control over the foods that are prepared and which they eat, and which helps to foster identity. The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility of outcome measurements and sample size when conducting a pilot cluster randomized trial to evaluate community-dwelling older adults being involved in activities in relation to meals in a rehabilitation program. METHODS: This cluster randomized controlled study will consist of two clusters of a total of 5 community aged care areas; the intervention cluster, which hold 3 community aged care areas and the control cluster which hold 2 areas. The 130 community-dwelling older adults, receiving meals-on-wheels, will randomly be allocated to either the intervention cluster consisting of 8 weeks of participation in a rehabilitation program led by a Case Manager or the control cluster receiving usual community aged care. The primary outcome will be assessment of data collection (ratio between completed- and non-completed data) and assessment of sample size. The secondary clinical outcomes will be health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3 L), muscle strength (chair stand), nutritional status (weight/BMI), loneliness (UCLA scale), mental well-being (Warwich-Edinburgh scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy scale), satisfaction with food-related life (SWFL scale) and refrigerator content. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates community-dwelling older adults receiving support at home, using involvement in activities related to meals with a rehabilitation approach, and this is a new area of research and will therefore be contributing in developing and refining consistent practices of rehabilitation programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (registration no: NCT03289598) The protocol has been sent to the Danish Ethical Board which has concluded that approval is not needed and that the study can be carried on as described Approval by The Danish Data Protection Agency has been giving through general approval for use of data in The City of Odense and will follow rules for obtaining the data accordingly [SEP] Activities of daily living; Community health care; Dwelling older adults; Meals on wheels; Rehabilitation

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of nivolumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after radical resection in patients with MIUC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 709 patients in CheckMate 274 (NCT02632409; 282 with programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression ≥1%), an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of adjuvant nivolumab INTERVENTION: Intravenous injection of nivolumab (240 mg) or placebo every 2 wk for ≤1 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D-3L. Linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures were used to compare nivolumab and placebo on changes in HRQoL. Time to confirmed deterioration (TTCD) of HRQoL was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the full HRQoL evaluable population, no clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was observed in either treatment arm. Moreover, nivolumab was noninferior to placebo on changes from baseline for all main outcomes. The median TTCD for fatigue was 41.0 wk for nivolumab and 44.3 wk for placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.39). For the visual analog scale, the median TTCD was not reached for nivolumab and it was 57.6 wk for placebo (HR: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.61-1.00). The median TTCD for the other main outcomes was not reached in either treatment arm. The findings were similar for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nivolumab did not compromise the HRQoL of patients with MIUC in CheckMate 274. PATIENT SUMMARY: Nivolumab is being researched as a new treatment for patients with bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma). We found that nivolumab maintained quality of life while increasing the time until cancer returns in patients whose bladder cancer had spread or grown and who had unsuccessfully tried platinum-containing chemotherapy [SEP] B7-H1 Antigen; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/drug therapy/surgery; Humans; Muscles; Nivolumab/therapeutic use; Platinum; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Quality of Life; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Adjuvant; Bladder cancer; Immunotherapy; Invasive; Nivolumab; Phase 3; Quality of life; Radical cystectomy; Randomized controlled trial

However, these interventions pose relatively new regulatory, organisational and technological challenges that limit appropriate evaluation. Lung Cancer App (LuCApp) is a mobile application developed by researchers and clinicians to promote real-time monitoring and management of patients' symptoms. This protocol illustrates a clinical trial designed to evaluate the usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LuCApp versus standard of care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a 24-week two-arm non-blinded multicentre parallel randomised controlled trial. A total of 120 adult patients diagnosed with small or non-small cell lung cancer and eligible for pharmaceutical treatments will be allocated 1:1 to receiving either standard care or LuCApp in addition to standard care at three oncology sites in Northern Italy. During the treatment period, LuCApp allows daily monitoring and grading of a list of symptoms, which trigger alerts to the physicians in case predefined severity thresholds are met. Patients will complete a baseline assessment and a set of valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures every 3±1 weeks, and up to 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the score of the Trial Outcome Index in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (Lung) questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are the Lung Cancer Subscale, the EuroQoL 5D-5L questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form, the app usability questionnaire and the Zarit Burden Interview for the main caregiver. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethical approval from the three clinical sites. Trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations CONCLUSIONS: This trial makes a timely contribution to test a mobile application designed to improve the quality of life and delivery of care for patients with lung cancer.

46	0	Locking Plate Arthrodesis Compares Favorably with LRTI for Thumb Trapeziometacarpal Arthrosis: Early Outcomes from a Longitudinal Cohort Study [SEP] BACKGROUND: Trapeziometacarpal arthrodesis (TMA) has been complicated by nonunion and hardware failure. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We hypothesized that modification of the TMA technique with a locking cage plate construct would afford reliable bony union while producing greater hand function than trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) at early follow-up. METHODS: We enrolled 36 consecutive patients with trapeziometacapal osteoarthritis (14 TMA patients (15 thumbs), 22 LRTI patients (22 thumbs)). The study was powered to detect a minimal clinically important difference on the QuickDASH questionnaire between groups. Secondary outcomes included Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), VAS-pain, and EQ-5D-3L scores. Patients were examined to evaluate thumb motion and strength. TMA patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically for union. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15.6 months, and the mean age was 59.2 years Union was achieved in 14/15 (93%) of TMA thumbs. Improvement in QuickDASH scores was similar after TMA and LRTI (49 to 28 and 50 to 18, respectively) Postoperative patient-rated upper extremity function, health status, and pain were similar between groups. Pinch strength was significantly greater after TMA (5.9 vs 4.7 kg). No differences in thumb or wrist range of motion were observed postoperatively with the exception of greater total metacarpophalangeal joint motion after TMA. Complications after TMA included nonunion (7%), development of symptomatic scaphotrapezotrapezoidal (STT) arthrosis (7%), symptomatic hardware (7%), and superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) paresthesia (7%) Complications after LRTI included subsidence (5%), MP hyperextension deformity (5%), and SBRN paresthesias (5%). CONCLUSIONS: At early follow-up, patient-rated function was similar among patients undergoing TMA and LRTI. TMA produced 25% greater pinch strength compared with LRTI. Despite historical concerns regarding global loss of ROM with arthrodesis, motion was similar between groups. Our observed TMA nonunion rate of 7% is low relative to historically reported nonunion rates (7-16%). Locking cage plate technology affords rigid fixation for TMA with promising early results noting reliable bony union while minimizing complications [SEP] LRTI; basal joint arthritis; fusion; thumb CMC; trapeziometacarpal

A daily, single-item, self-reported SD 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) was recently developed to assess SD for patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but its psychometric properties have not yet been described. OBJECTIVES: To assess the psychometric properties of the SD NRS in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: The psychometric properties of the SD NRS were assessed using data from a phase IIb clinical trial in 218 adults with moderate-to-severe AD. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of the SD NRS was substantial to almost perfect (interclass correlation 0·66-1·00) in participants who had stable SD or stable pruritus scores over 1 week. Baseline correlations were moderate to large (r > 0·30) between SD NRS and pruritus or sleep loss scores, but were small (r = -0·11 to 0·17) between SD NRS and EQ-5D-3L index and visual analogue scores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, and Investigator's Global Assessment. The SD NRS could discriminate groups of participants in the expected direction according to different quality-of-life scores but not according to different clinician-reported disease severity scores. SD NRS scores significantly decreased as sleep loss, itch and quality-of-life scores improved Analysis of meaningful change suggested a 2-5-point improvement as the initial range of responder definition in the SD NRS score. CONCLUSIONS: The SD NRS is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of SD in adults with moderate-to-severe AD [SEP] Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic/complications/diagnosis; Humans; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients with psoriasis enrolled in the Corrona Psoriasis Registry between April 2015 and May 2018 who initiated a biologic therapy at registry enrollment. Patients were stratified by the presence of scalp, nail, or palmoplantar psoriasis (nonmutually exclusive groups). Patient demographics, clinical char-acteristics, disease activity, and patient-reported outcome measures (pain, fatigue, itch, EuroQol visual analog scale [EQ VAS], Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire [WPAI]) were assessed at registry enrollment and compared between patients with versus without each challenging-to-treat area using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Generalized linear regression models were used to estimate differences in disease activity and patient-reported outcomes between patients with versus without each challenging-to-treat area RESULTS: Among 2,042 patients with psoriasis (mean age [±SD], 49.6 ± 14.7 years; 51.5% male), 38.4% had psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 38.1% had scalp psoriasis, 16.0% had nail psoriasis, 10.9% had palmoplantar psoriasis, and 26.2% had a combination of ≥2 challenging-to-treat areas and PsA; only 34.2% had body plaque psoriasis without PsA or challenging-to-treat areas. Patients in all challenging-to-treat groups reported higher (mean [95% CI]) itch (scalp, 58.01 [57.62-58.40] vs. 54.35 [53.99-54.72]; nail, 56.42 [56.02-56.81] vs. 55.59 [55.20-55.97]; palmoplantar, 60.22 [59.86-60.59] vs. 55.15 [54.79-55.54]) and lower EQ VAS (scalp, 68.12 [67.78-68.48] vs. 69.46 [69.12-69.81]; nail, 66.21 [65.89-66.55] vs. 69.48 [69.14-69.83]; palmoplantar, 66.21 [66.07-66.75] vs 69.29 [68.94-69.94]) scores than those without the respective challenging-to-treat localization. Patients with nail or palmoplantar psoriasis reported higher pain, fatigue, and DLQI scores than those without. Higher proportions of patients with scalp or palmoplantar psoriasis reported work impairment compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients with psoriasis who initiated biologic therapy had PsA and/or ≥1 challenging-to-treat area. Patients with challenging-to-treat areas had worse patient-reported outcome scores than those without, indicating a significant burden of challenging-to-treat areas on patients' quality of life [SEP] Adult; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psoriasis/pathology/psychology/therapy; Quality of Life; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; United States; Psoriasis; Quality of life; Real-world evidence; Registry
49	1	Surgical outcomes between posterior decompression alone and posterior decompression with fusion surgery among patients with Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis: a multicenter cohort study [SEP] BACKGROUND: Whether lumbar decompression with fusion surgery is effective against Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is unknown. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes between posterior decompression alone and posterior decompression with fusion surgery among patients with grade 2 DS with central canal stenosis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included prospectively registered patients (n = 3863) who underwent surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis at nine high-volume spine centers from April 2017 to July 2019. Patients with grade 2 DS and central canal stenosis were included in the analysis. Patients with radiculopathy, including foraminal stenosis, degenerative scoliosis, and concomitant anterior spinal fusion, and those with a previous history of lumbar surgery were excluded. The participants were divided into the decompression alone group (group D) and decompression with fusion surgery group (group F). Data about patient-reported outcomes, including Numeric Rating Scale (low back pain, leg pain, leg numbness, and foot numbness), Oswestry Disability Index, EuroQol Five-Dimensional questionnaire, and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores, were obtained preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: In total, 2354 (61%) patients, including 42 (1.8%) with grade 2 DS (n = 18 in group D and n = 24 in group F), completed the 2-year follow-up. Group D had a higher proportion of female patients than group F. However, the two groups did not significantly differ in terms of other baseline demographic characteristics. Group D had a significantly shorter surgical time and lower volume of intraoperative blood loss than group F. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes did not significantly differ between the two groups, although the preoperative degree of low back pain was higher in group F than in group D. The slip degree of group D did not worsen during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: The surgical outcomes were similar regardless of the addition of fusion surgery among patients with grade 2 DS Decompression alone was superior to decompression with fusion surgery as it was associated with a lower volume of intraoperative blood loss and shorter surgical time [SEP] Blood Loss, Surgical; Cohort Studies; Constriction, Pathologic/complications/surgery; Decompression, Surgical/adverse effects/methods; Female; Humans; Hypesthesia/surgery; Low Back Pain/surgery; Lumbar Vertebrae/surgery; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Fusion/adverse effects/methods; Spinal Stenosis/complications/surgery; Spondylolisthesis/complications/surgery; Treatment Outcome; Central canal stenosis; Decompression; Fusion; Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis; Multicenter retrospective cohort study; Patient-reported outcome measure
50	1	A Multicomponent Exercise Intervention that Reverses Frailty and Improves Cognition, Emotion, and Social Networking in the Community-Dwelling Frail Elderly: A Randomized Clinical Trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: Frailty can be an important clinical target to reduce rates of disability. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain if a supervised-facility multicomponent exercise program (MEP) when performed by frail older persons can reverse frailty and improve functionality; cognitive, emotional, and social networking; as well as biological biomarkers of frailty, when compared with a controlled population that received no training. DESIGN: This is an interventional, controlled, simple randomized study. Researchers responsible for data gathering were blinded for this study. SETTING: Participants from 2 primary rural care centers (Sollana and Carcaixent) of the same health department in Spain were enrolled in the study between December 2013 and September 2014. PATIENTS: We randomized a volunteer sample of 100 men and women who were sedentary, with a gait speed lower than 0.8 meters per second and frail (met at least 3 of the frailty phenotype criteria). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a supervised-facility MEP (n = 51, age = 79.5, SD 3.9) that included proprioception, aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises for 65 minutes, 5 days per week, 24 weeks, or to a control group (n = 49, age = 80.3, SD 3.7). The intervention was performed by 8 experienced physiotherapists or nurses. Protein-calorie and vitamin D supplementation were controlled in both groups. RESULTS: Our MEP reverses frailty (number needed to treat to recover robustness in subjects with attendance to ≥50% of the training sessions was 3.2) and improves functional measurements: Barthel (trained group 91.6 SD 8.0 vs 82.0 SD 11.0 control group), Lawton and Brody (trained group 6.9 SD 0.9 vs 5.7 SD 2.0 control group), Tinetti (trained group 24.5 SD 4.4 vs 21.7 SD 4.5 control group), Short Physical Performance Battery (trained group 9.5 SD 1.8 vs 7.1 SD 2.8 control group), and physical performance test (trained group 23.5 SD 5.9 vs 16.5 SD 5.1 control group) as well as cognitive, emotional, and social networking determinations: Mini-Mental State Examination (trained group 28.9 SD 3.9 vs 25.9 SD 7.3 control group), geriatric depression scale from Yesavage (trained group 2.3 SD 2.2 vs 3.2 SD 2.0 control group), EuroQol quality-of-life scale (trained group 8.2 SD 1.6 vs 7.6 SD 1.3 control group), and Duke social support (trained group 48.5 SD 9.3 vs 41.2 SD 8.5 control group). This program is unique in that it leads to a decrease in the number of visits to primary care physician (trained group 1.3 SD 1.4 vs 2.4 SD 2.9 control group) and to a significant improvement in frailty biomarkers CONCLUSIONS: We have designed a multicomponent exercise intervention that reverses frailty and improves cognition, emotional, and social networking in a controlled population of community-dwelling frail older adults.

51	1	Persistent immune-related adverse events after cessation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Prevalence and impact on patients' health-related quality of life [SEP] BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may induce persistent immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We investigated persistent irAEs and implications on patients' lives compared to non-ICI-induced autoimmune diseases (AIs). METHODS: The multicentre, cross-sectional study comprised 200 patients with cancer ≥12 weeks after ICI cessation (ICI-patients) and 2705 patients with AIs (AI-patients), recruited in German outpatient clinics and support groups. The prevalence of persistent irAEs subdivided in long-term (12 weeks to <12 months) and chronic irAEs (≥12 months) since ICI discontinuation, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EuroQol 5D-5L (EQ-Index/VAS score), and burden of autoimmune symptoms and respective therapies were assessed. RESULTS: Long-term/chronic irAEs occurred in 51.9%/35.5% of outpatient ICI-patients, including arthralgia (16.7%/16.1%), myalgia (13.0%/14.0%), hypothyroidism (11.1%/10.8%), xerostomia (7.4%/8.6%), vitiligo (13.0%/7.5%) and hypophysitis (9.3%/7.5%). ICI-patients with long-term/chronic irAEs reported clinically significantly reduced HRQoL compared to ICI-patients without long-term/chronic irAEs (EQ-Index score: 0.767/0.752 versus 0.920/0.923, p < 0.001/0.001; EQ-VAS score: 52.2/52.0 versus 63.6/74.7, p =/< 0.040/0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses confirmed clinically significant reductions in HRQoL scores by chronic irAEs (EQ-Index/VAS score: -0.163/-23.4, p < 0.001/0.001). HRQoL, burden of autoimmune symptoms and burden of respective therapies in ICI-patients with chronic irAEs were similar to AI-patients with non-exacerbated AIs. Patients with chronic irAEs felt inadequately informed about side-effects compared to patients without chronic irAEs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Persistent irAEs impose a significant burden on patients after ICI cessation. Especially in early tumour stages, risk-benefit ratios must be carefully evaluated, and patients need to be informed about potential long-term sequelae [SEP] Autoimmunity; Cancer survivors; Chronic immune-related adverse events (chronic irAEs); Health-related quality of life (HRQoL); Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); Immunotherapy; Long-term sequelae; Melanoma; Persistent toxicities; Prevalence
52	0	VASO (Vitamin D and Arthroplasty Surgery Outcomes) study - supplementation of vitamin D deficiency to improve outcomes after total hip or knee replacement: study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to poor outcomes after total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR), including lower patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), peri-prosthetic infection and longer hospital stay. We present a randomised feasibility trial protocol designed to prospectively investigate the influence of vitamin D testing, and subsequent supplementation for deficiency, prior to THR/TKR. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred adult patients undergoing primary THR/TKR for osteoarthritis at two NHS hospital trusts in North East England will be recruited. Exclusion criteria include lack of mental capacity, revision surgery, participants already taking vitamin D/calcium supplements, or a known contraindication to vitamin D treatment Participants will be ineligible for the trial if they have an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/minute. We will measure patients' vitamin D levels at baseline, and those identified as deficient (vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) will be randomised to receive either vitamin D supplementation or no supplementation prior to, and for 6 months following, surgery. Patients with a normal vitamin D level (≥50 nmol/L) will receive no supplementation. Vitamin D levels will be rechecked on the day of surgery and again at 6 months. Patients will also complete a lifestyle questionnaire, as well as the Oxford hip or knee and EQ-5D-3 L PROM questionnaires, at baseline and at 6 months following surgery The aims are to determine the feasibility of the methodology and to gather data to inform the conduct of a future, larger trial to investigate if supplementation with vitamin D, in those who are deficient, prior to THR/TKR improves outcomes as measured by PROM scores. DISCUSSION: Previous reports have measured vitamin D levels and correlated this to outcome, but we can find no randomised trial in which researchers investigated the effect of supplementation. The aim of this trial is to determine if vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor for poor outcome after THR/TKR.

53	1	na [SEP] BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an irreversible fibrosing lung disorder with a poor prognosis. Current treatments slow the rate of decline in lung function and may influence survival, but they have a significant side-effect profile and so additional therapeutic options are required. People with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have altered innate immunity and altered lung microbiota, with the bacterial burden relating to mortality. Two randomised controlled trials have demonstrated beneficial effects with co-trimoxazole (SEPTRIN(®); Essential Generics Ltd, Egham, UK; Chemidex Generics Ltd, Egham, UK), with the suggestion of an improvement in rates of survival. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy of co-trimoxazole in people with moderate to severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. DESIGN: A Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised multicentre study. SETTING: UK specialist interstitial lung disease centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who were randomised had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team. In addition, patients had significant breathlessness (i.e. a Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of > 1) and impaired lung function (i.e. a forced vital capacity of < 75% predicted). Patients could be taking licensed medication for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but were excluded if they had significant comorbidities, including airflow obstruction. INTERVENTION: Oral co-trimoxazole, 960 mg twice per day (two 480-mg tablets twice per day), compared with placebo tablets (two tablets twice per day) for a median of 27 months (range 12–42 months). Otherwise, both trial groups had standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time to death (all causes), transplant or first non-elective hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary end point and the number of respiratory-related events Questionnaires (the King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire; the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale; EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version; the Leicester Cough Questionnaire; and the Cough Symptom Score) and lung function tests (forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) were undertaken at baseline and at 12 months. RESULTS: The trial randomised a total of 342 (295 male) patients (active treatment group, n = 170; placebo group, n = 172), using minimisation for hospital and receipt of licensed antifibrotic medication, from 39 UK hospitals. The patients had a mean (standard deviation) age of 71.3 years (7.47 years) and a mean forced vital capacity of 2.25 l (0.56 l). A total of 137 (40%) patients were taking pirfenidone (Esbriet, Roche Holding AG, Basel, Switzerland) and 116 (34%) were taking nintedanib (Ofev(®), Boehringer Ingelheim, Brackness, UK). There was one post-randomisation exclusion from the co-trimoxazole group, but no withdrawals. There was no difference in the time to event for the composite primary end point (co-trimoxazole: hazard ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.6; p = 0.319). Likewise, there was no difference in other event outcomes, lung function measurements or patient-reported outcomes, other than a beneficial effect on the total Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, the social domain of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire score and the chest domain of the King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire in the adjusted analysis. The repeated-measures analysis showed a significant overall difference in Cough Symptom Score. There were significantly more reports of nausea, but fewer reports of diarrhoea, with co-trimoxazole; however, differences in frequency of hyperkalaemia, rash and headache were not significant. The limitations of the trial were that it was not possible to evaluate the lung microbiota, there were missing data for secondary end points and there was no health economic analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that co-trimoxazole does not reduce the likelihood of death or number of hospitalisations among people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with moderate to severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further work is required to evaluate the effect in subgroups of individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or the effect of antibiotics with different antibacterial properties.

55	1	Health utility measured with EQ-5D in Thai patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [SEP] OBJECTIVES: To measure health utility by using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) in Thai patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and to examine the relationship between the EQ-5D and patient characteristics including sociodemographic and clinical data and end-stage renal disease symptoms. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. About 10 to 12 patients undergoing PD were randomly selected from each of the 10 hospitals located in every part of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from October 2008 to February 2009. Patients assessed their health status by using five domains and a visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D score was calculated on the basis of responses to five domains by using the Thai value set. Multiple regression analyses using a stepwise method were employed to model the associations between the EQ-5D score, the VAS score, and patient characteristics. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 42.2 ± 13.8 years; 53% were male. The mean PD duration was 7.4 ± 6.0 months. The mean EQ-5D and visual analogue scale scores were 0.65 ± 0.23 and 0.65 ± 0.26, respectively. The EQ-5D score was higher than that obtained from a meta-analysis study (0.58). The multivariate regression model showed that education, work status, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease symptoms were significant predictors of the EQ-5D score. The significant predictors of the VAS score included work status, albumin level, use of erythropoietin, and end-stage renal disease symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This Thai PD sample yielded higher EQ-5D scores than did other PD populations. To improve the health utility of Thai patients undergoing PD, the significant factors should be addressed. Because our PD sample had a short PD duration, their long-term health utility should be evaluated in future research [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/psychology/therapy; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Pain/etiology/psychology; Peritoneal Dialysis/psychology; Quality of Life; Self Care/psychology; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Thailand; Young Adult
56	1	A comparison of the EuroQol-5D and the Health Utilities Index mark 3 in patients with rheumatic disease [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of 2 commonly used utility-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments [the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3)] in patients with rheumatic disease METHODS: Consecutive outpatients with rheumatic diseases were interviewed twice within 2 weeks using a standard questionnaire containing the EQ-5D, HUI3, and the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36, used to categorize health status) and assessing clinical and demographic characteristics. EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores were compared and their construct validity and test-retest reliability were examined by comparing these scores in groups differing in health status and using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively RESULTS: EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores in 114 patients differentiated well between varying health states; e.g., patients with higher SF-36 vitality scores had better EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores (mean: 0.79 for both instruments) than patients with lower vitality scores (mean: 0.68 and 0.69, respectively) (p < 0.01 for both comparisons). ICC values for the EQ-5D and HUI3 were 0.64 and 0.75, respectively (n = 90, median interval: 7 days). EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores were similar (mean +/- SD: 0.75 +/- 0.21 vs 0.76 +/- 0.17, p = 0.647, paired t test) and showed moderate correlation (Spearman's r: 0.45, p < 0.001) Differences were present in patients' responses to these 2 instruments: e.g., 12 patients reporting no problems with mobility (EQ-5D item) reported different levels of disability with ambulation (HUI3 item). CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D and HUI3 performed equally well in measuring utility-based HRQoL in patients with rheumatic disease, although they measured slightly different, though related, dimensions of health [SEP] Adult; Asians; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Predictive Value of Tests; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Rheumatic Diseases/physiopathology; Severity of Illness Index; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards
57	1	Population norms for the EQ-5D index scores using Singapore preference weights [SEP] PURPOSE: To provide norms for the EQ-5D index scores based on Singapore preference weights according to age, sex, ethnicity, and language version and compare the EQ-5D index scores for respondents with and without psychiatric disorders and chronic medical conditions. METHODS: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of a nationally representative sample of the resident (citizens and permanent residents) population in Singapore. The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were established using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Index scores were derived using the Singapore preference weights RESULTS: In general, the mean EQ-5D index score using Singapore preference weights decreased with increased age. The EQ-5D Malay version reported lower mean EQ-5D index than the English version. In multivariate analysis, the mean EQ-5D index for respondents with MDD, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, GAD, OCD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, neurological condition, stroke or major paralysis, heart attack, back problems, stomach ulcer, kidney failure, migraine headaches, and chronic lung disease was significantly lower than those without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the Singapore preference weights for EQ-5D valuations when measuring health-related quality of life and comparing the health burden of psychiatric and chronic physical conditions among adults in Singapore [SEP] Adult; Age Factors; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Quality of Life; Sex Factors; Singapore/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards
58	1	Validity and reliability of three commonly used quality of life measures in a large European population of coronary heart disease patients [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity and reliability of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12v2), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a stable coronary population. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study EUROASPIRE III. SETTING: Quality of life data (QoL) were available on 8745 patients hospitalized for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or myocardial ischemia. They were interviewed and examined at least 6 months after their hospital admission. Reliability and validity of the 3 instruments were tested. Internal consistency, and discriminative, convergent, criterion and construct validity were assessed. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha indicated good internal consistency for all measures (0.73 to 0.87). Discriminative validity analyses confirmed significant QoL differences between known groups: age, gender, educational level. In addition, all hypothesized correlations between QoL constructs (convergent validity) and items (criterion validity) were confirmed with significant correlations. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated good construct validity for HADS and SF-12v2. On country-specific level, results were roughly similar. CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D as well as the SF-12v2 and the HADS are reliable and valid instruments for use in a stable coronary population, both on aggregate European level and on country-specific level. However, our results must be generalized with caution, because EUROASPIRE III patients might not be representative for all patients with stable coronary heart disease [SEP] Aged; Coronary Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies/methods/standards; Europe/epidemiology; Female; Health Surveys/methods/standards; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance/methods; Quality of Life/psychology; Reproducibility of Results; Coronary patients; EQ-5D; HADS; Psychometric; Quality of life; SF-12
59	1	Study on health-related quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure before and after transplantation [SEP] Our objective was to evaluate health-related quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure on the waiting list for a heart transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed using the EUROQOL-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) on 38 patients (age: 53 +/- 2 years, 82% men) who were analyzed consecutively during the pretransplant period, as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. We excluded pediatric transplants, retransplantations, heart and lung transplantation, and patients scoring below 17 points on the Folstein's Cognitive Mini-Examination. The studied variables included the five dimensions of the EQ-5D test: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain-discomfort, anxiety and depression; a visual analog scale from 0 to 100; and perception of health status. Statistics included analysis of variance and chi-square tests Significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: There were significant differences in all tested parameters. The worst values were observed prior to transplantation, with a significant improvement at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with heart failure showed a significant impairment in health-related quality of life before transplantation. The improvement in health-related quality of life was significant and rapidly evident in the posttransplantation period. The most affected dimensions were activities of daily living and pain-discomfort. All dimensions became stable at 3 months, except for anxiety and depression. At 6 to 12 months, a plateau was reached in the feelings of well-being [SEP] Adult; Cognition; Female; Health Status; Heart Transplantation/physiology/psychology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Quality of Life; Reoperation; Surveys and Questionnaires
60	1	Validation of two generic patient-reported outcome measures in patients with type 2 diabetes [SEP] BACKGROUND: Prior to using a generic patient-reported outcome measure (PRO), the measure should be validated within the target population. The purpose of the current study was to validate two generic measures in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes in Scotland and England completed two generic measures: EQ-5D and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB). Two diabetes-specific measures were administered: ADS and DSC-R. Analyses assessed reliability and validity. RESULTS: There were 130 participants (53 Scotland; 77 England; 64% male; mean age = 55.7 years). Responses on the EQ-5D and PGWB reflected moderate impairment consistent with previous diabetes samples: mean EQ-5D Index score, 0.75; EQ-5D VAS, 68.8; PGWB global score, 67.9. All scales of the PGWB demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.77 to 0.97). The EQ-5D and PGWB demonstrated convergent validity through significant correlations with the ADS (r = 0.48 to 0.61), DSC-R scales (r = 0.33 to 0.81 except ophthalmology subscale), and Body Mass Index (r = 0.15 to 0.38). The EQ-5D and PGWB discriminated between groups of patients known to differ in diabetes-related characteristics (e.g., history of hypoglycemia) CONCLUSION: Results support the use of the EQ-5D and PGWB among patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly in combination with condition-specific measures [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/physiopathology/psychology/therapy; England; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Psychometrics/instrumentation; Quality of Life; Scotland; Sickness Impact Profile; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires
61	1	Self-reported chronic conditions and EQ-5D index scores in the US adult population [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To examine the unique health-related quality of life (HRQoL) decrements associated with common chronic conditions in the general US adult population. METHODS: Data were obtained from a study aimed at establishing a US population-based set of preference weights for the health states defined by the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a brief, self-completed instrument for describing and valuing HRQoL. As part of that study, along with the EQ-5D items, data regarding socio-demographic characteristics and chronic medical conditions were collected The EQ-5D has five dimensions, from which an index score can be calculated that falls on a scale where 0.0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health. Ordinary least squares regression models were conducted using the EQ-5D index score as the dependent variable to estimate the association between each chronic condition and the index score after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. The population sampling weights were applied in the analyses to adjust for the over-sampling of the minority groups. RESULTS: Approximately three-fifths (62.5%) of the study sample reported having at least one of the 18 chronic medical conditions; sinusitis(24.8%), hypertension (23.5%), and arthritis (21.5%) were the most commonly reported conditions. The chronic conditions that had the greatest negative association with EQ-5D index scores were depression and arthritis CONCLUSION: Unique associations were found between several chronic conditions and HRQoL after accounting for the presence of other conditions and socio-demographic characteristics. The results of this study provide an indication of the relative HRQoL decrements associated with various chronic conditions in the general US adult population. The major limitation of this analysis is the uncertainty of the causal relationship between chronic conditions and HRQoL due to the cross-sectional nature of the study data. In addition, because it was unknown how well the conditions were managed, caution is needed in interpreting study results regarding the relative impact of chronic conditions on HRQoL [SEP] Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology
62	1	How does Parkinson's disease affect quality of life? A comparison with quality of life in the general population [SEP] BACKGROUND: Adequate provision of appropriate healthcare resources for patients with chronic neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) requires knowledge of the impact of the illness on their life. Quality of life (QoL) instruments measure the impact of the disease on general well-being that cannot be fully appreciated by clinical rating scales and allow comparisons with other patient groups and the general population. OBJECTIVES: To assess QoL in a population-based sample of patients with PD in different disease stages in comparison with the general population. METHODS: All 124 patients with PD seen in a population-based study on the prevalence of parkinsonism in the London area were asked to complete a QoL battery including the EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D), the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF 36), and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease questionnaire (PDQ-39). An interview and complete neurologic examination, including the Hoehn and Yahr scale, were performed on the same day. The patients' QoL scores were compared with published QoL norms from the United Kingdom population. RESULTS: Quality of life, as measured by the PDQ-39, the EQ-5D, and the physical summary of the SF 36, deteriorated significantly with increasing disease severity. The greatest impairment was seen in the areas related to physical and social functioning, whereas reports of pain and poor emotional adjustment had similar prevalence in patients with PD and the general population The impairment of QoL was seen in all age groups and was similar for men and women, but the differences between patients with PD and the general population were most marked in the younger patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease interferes with various aspects of QoL, particularly those related to physical and social functioning. This information should be taken into account in the clinical management and planning and allocation of healthcare resources to this population [SEP] Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurologic Examination; Pain/psychology; Parkinson Disease/epidemiology/psychology; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Social Adjustment; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom/epidemiology
63	0	Effect of spironolactone on physical performance in older people with self-reported physical disability [SEP] BACKGROUND: Interventions that improve muscle function may slow decline in physical function and disability in later life. Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may maintain muscle function. We evaluated the effect of aldosterone blockade on physical performance in functionally impaired older people without heart failure. METHODS: In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 years with self-reported problems with activities of daily living were randomized to receive 25 mg spironolactone or identical placebo daily for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walking distance over 20 weeks. Secondary outcomes were changes in Timed Up and Go test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, Functional Limitation Profile, EuroQol EQ-5D, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale over 20 weeks. RESULTS: Participants' mean (standard deviation) age was 75 (6) years. Of the 93% of participants (112/120) who completed the study, 106 remained on medication at 20 weeks. There was no significant difference in change in 6-minute walking distance at 20 weeks between the spironolactone and placebo groups (mean change, -3.2 m; 95% confidence interval, -28.9 to 22.5; P = .81). Quality of life improved significantly at 20 weeks, with an increase in EuroQol EQ-5D score of 0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.18; P < .01) in the spironolactone group relative to the placebo group. There were no significant differences in between-group change for other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone was well tolerated but did not improve physical function in older people without heart failure. Quality of life improved significantly, and the possible mechanisms for this require further study [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Double-Blind Method; Exercise/physiology; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Spironolactone/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Surveys and Questionnaires; Walking/physiology
64	1	Quality of Life Following Treatment of Trochanteric Fractures with Proximal Femoral Nail versus Cementless Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty in Elderly [SEP] PURPOSE: There is currently no gold standard treatment for unstable intertrochanteric fractures of the elderly. Internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty are two common treatment methods but studies comparing the functional outcomes of these procedures in the elderly are limited. This study evaluates the functional outcomes of hip fracture patients treated either with internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: Eighty-six elderly (>60 years) patients who presented with isolated, unstable intertrochanteric fractures between 2009 and 2013 were included in the study. According to the classification of Association for Osteosynthesis/Orthopaedic Trauma Association; 12 of the patients had a 31A1.3 fracture type, 36 of the patients had 31A2.2 and 19 had 31A2.3 fracture type, 12 had 31A3.1 and seven had 31A3.3 fracture. Forty-two of 86 hip patients (Group 1) were treated with intramedullary nailing and antirotator proximal femoral nail implant (TST, Turkey), and 44 (Group 2) were treated with cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Preoperative social function (Jensen) score, EQ-5D index score and mobility (Palmer/Parker) scores were obtained. Five dimensions of EQ-5D were obtained at every follow-up visit until 24 months postoperative. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between two groups according to preoperative demographic variables, including mean age and sex and Jensen, Palmer/Parker,EQ-5D index, five dimensions of EQ-5D and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. At end of 24 months follow-up, health-related quality of life had increased more in Group 1 and they reported better social functioning and mobility scores (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Internal fixation resulted in better social functioning and mobility scores compared with cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty at the end of 24 months in treatment of unstable pertrochanteric hip fracture in the elderly [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Bone Nails; Female; Femur Head/surgery; Fracture Fixation, Internal/instrumentation/methods; Hemiarthroplasty/methods; Hip Fractures/surgery; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Social Participation
65	1	Differences between hypothetical and experience-based value sets for EQ-5D used in Sweden: Implications for decision makers [SEP] AIMS: A number of value sets are available today for converting EQ-5D questionnaire responses to quality-adjusted life year-weights used in health economic evaluations. The aim of this study is to analyse the differences between the commonly used hypothetical UK value set and the newly introduced Swedish experience-based value set and to evaluate health economic implications of such differences on policy decisions. METHODS: Differences between the two value sets were studied using two methods: a comparison of health states and improvements as well as an empirical comparison. In the comparison of health states and improvements, the valuations of all EQ-5D states and all pure improvements were compared. In the empirical study, a database of 23,925 individuals was used to identify patient groups that could be affected by the implementation of the Swedish experience-based value set. RESULTS: The comparison of health states and possible improvements showed that only three health states were assigned a lower quality-adjusted life year-weight and most improvements were given smaller absolute values if the experience-based value set was used. The empirical comparison showed that severe conditions were assigned higher values when using the experience-based value set. CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish experience-based value set seems to render a higher estimated level of health-related quality of life in virtually all health conditions compared to the hypothetical UK value set. In extension, health-related quality of life enhancing interventions are likely to be given higher priority in decision-making situations where hypothetical values are used to construct quality-adjusted life year-weights. In situations where experience-based quality-adjusted life year-weights are used, life-prolonging interventions would be prioritised [SEP] Health Policy; Health Status; Humans; Policy Making; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Reproducibility of Results; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden; United Kingdom; EQ-5D; Economic evaluations; quality-adjusted life years
66	1	Factors that predicted change in health-related quality of life were identified in a cohort of diabetes mellitus type 1 patients [SEP] OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sociodemographic and diabetes-specific characteristics can predict the rate of change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time in patients with diabetes mellitus type I (DMT1). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A Dutch cohort of 234 patients with DMT1 was followed for 6 years (1995-2001). HRQOL (RAND-36 and EuroQol) and several demographic and clinical patient characteristics were recorded annually during the study period. Baseline characteristics associated with rate of change in HRQOL were identified using an individual linear growth model. RESULTS: Patients showed a statistically significant decrease over time in most HRQOL scales. Higher baseline diastolic blood pressure was predictive of a faster decrease in RAND-36 PCS score (-0.025, P = .02). Patients with nephropathy showed a faster decrease in PCS (-0.749, P = .003), and those with intermittent claudication a faster decrease in EQ-5D (-0.049, P = .008). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with DMT1, it was possible to identify factors predicting change in HRQOL. Late complications and risk factors for the development and progression of these complications are predictive of a lower HRQOL in the coming years [SEP] Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/psychology; Female; Health Status; Humans; Hypertension/complications; Intermittent Claudication/complications; Kidney Diseases/complications; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life
67	0	[Quality of life and burden of disease in peripheral arterial disease: a study among Hungarian patients] [SEP] INTRODUCTION: Peripheral arterial disease may occur in about of 14% of patients with high blood pressure, of which 1-3% suffer from chronic critical limb ischemia. Literature data on the quality of life according to the Fontaine stages are very limited. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of Hungarian patients with peripheral arterial disease regarding Fontaine stages II, III and IV. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional survey, which was carried out in four angiologic centres. One hundred and two respondents with peripheral arterial disease (43% woman) were evaluated. The average age of the patients was 70 years (SD-10). RESULTS: Based on the EQ-5D index, the results of the quality of life assessment with respect to Fontaine stages II, III and IV were 0.66, 0.35 and 0.18, respectively. In each stage the EQ-5D values were lower than the values of the age-matched average population. The results of the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (0-100 mm) were 38, 65 and 71 mm in Fontaine stages II, III and IV, respectively, and this showed a strong correlation with the EQ-5D (R = -0.68). In stage Fontaine IV the quality of life of the patients was significantly lower among those who had pain at rest and ALSO ulcer on the leg CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral disease with clinical symptoms causes significant reduction in quality of life which can be measured with EQ-5D. It becomes worse as we move along the Fontaine stages. While measuring the health gain in stage Fontaine IV, the health gain from the reduction of pain in rest and partial recovery from ulcer should be taken into account [SEP] Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hungary/epidemiology; Ischemia/complications/etiology; Leg/blood supply; Leg Ulcer/complications/etiology; Male; Middle Aged; Pain/etiology; Pain Measurement; Peripheral Arterial; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome
68	1	Physical activity and health outcomes in persons with haemophilia B [SEP] Regular participation in physical activity helps to prevent damage and maintain joint health in persons with haemophilia. This study describes self-reported physical activity participation among a sample of people with haemophilia B in the US and measures its association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Data on 135 participants aged 5-64 years were abstracted from Hemophilia Utilization Group Study Part Vb. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed physical activity among participants aged 15-64 years, and the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire abstracted from the Canadian Community Health Survey was used for participants aged 5-14 years. SF-12 was used to measure HRQoL and the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) was used to measure health status for participants older than 18 years of age. PedsQL was used to measure HRQoL in children aged 5-18 years. Sixty-two percent of participants in the 15-64 year-old age cohort reported a high level of physical activity, 29% reported moderate activity and 9% reported low activity. For children aged 5-14 years, 79% reported participating in physical activity for at least 4 days over a typical week. Based on the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 79% of adults achieved the recommended physical activity level. Multivariable regression models indicated that adults who engaged in a high level of physical activity reported EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores that were 11.7 (P = 0.0726) points greater than those who engaged in moderate/low activity, indicating better health outcomes. Among children, no statistically significant differences in health outcomes were found between high and moderate or low activity groups [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Arthralgia; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Health Status; Hemophilia B/epidemiology; Humans; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Odds Ratio; Patient Outcome Assessment; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Self Report; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult; HUGS; IPAQ; haemophilia B; health outcome; physical activity; quality of life
69	1	Does FDG PET-assisted management of patients with left ventricular dysfunction improve quality of life? A substudy of the PARR-2 trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular dysfunction whose management is directed by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may have a quality of life (QOL) benefit over standard care. METHODS: Among 430 patients randomized in the PET and Recovery Following Revascularization (PARR)-2 trial to FDG PET-assisted management vs standard, QOL scores were obtained using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) in 427 patients at baseline (FDG PET n = 216; standard n = 211) and 355 patients at 12-month follow-up (FDG PET n = 184; standard n = 171). EQ-5D scores between FDG PET and standard arms were compared using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). Subgroup analysis compared EQ-5D scores between patients in FDG PET who adhered to PET recommendations (Adherence) vs standard using MMRM. Interaction of revascularization with management was assessed using a general linear model RESULTS: A trend toward higher EQ-5D scores in FDG PET was observed (P = 0.056) Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference favouring adherence (P = 0.04) Higher QOL at 6 months for FDG PET (P = 0.02) and Adherence (P = 0.02) were observed. For revascularization, an interaction with management (FDG PET vs standard) for QOL was observed (6 months: P = 0.01; 12 months: P = 0.1); Adherence (6 months: P = 0.01; 12 months: P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET-directed management improves QOL, at least in the short-term and with adherence to recommendations. This may relate to revascularization, and may indicate better treatment selection using FDG PET [SEP] Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Follow-Up Studies; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography/methods/standards; Quality of Life; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/psychology; Ventricular Function, Left
70	1	Radiofrequency ablation as initial therapy in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: results on health-related quality of life and symptom burden. The MANTRA-PAF trial [SEP] AIMS: The Medical ANtiarrhythmic Treatment or Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (MANTRA-PAF) trial assessed the long-term efficacy of an initial strategy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy (AAD) as first-line treatment for patients with PAF. In this substudy, we evaluated the effect of these treatment modalities on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom burden of patients at 12 and 24 months. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the study period, 294 patients were enrolled in the MANTRA-PAF trial and randomized to receive AAD (N = 148) or RFA (N = 146). Two generic questionnaires were used to assess the HRQoL [Short Form-36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-five dimensions (EQ-5D)], and the Arrhythmia-Specific questionnaire in Tachycardia and Arrhythmia (ASTA) was used to evaluate the symptoms appearing during the trial. All comparisons were made on an intention-to-treat basis. Both randomization groups showed significant improvements in assessments with both SF-36 and EQ-5D, at 24 months. Patients randomized to RFA showed significantly greater improvement in four physically related scales of the SF-36. The three most frequently reported symptoms were breathlessness during activity, pronounced tiredness, and worry/anxiety. In both groups, there was a significant reduction in ASTA symptom index and in the severity of seven of the eight symptoms over time. CONCLUSION: Both AAD and RFA as first-line treatment resulted in substantial improvement of HRQoL and symptom burden in patients with PAF Patients randomized to RFA showed greater improvement in physical scales (SF-36) and the EQ-visual analogue scale.

71	0	Is progression-free survival associated with a better health-related quality of life in patients with lung cancer? Evidence from two randomised trials with afatinib [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Progression-free survival (PFS) is frequently used as an efficacy end point in oncology clinical trials. However, there is limited evidence to support a positive association between improvement in PFS and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The association between PFS and HRQoL was evaluated in two randomised trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from two randomised controlled trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; LUX-Lung 1 and LUX-Lung 3) were used to investigate HRQoL in patients to determine whether tumour progression is accompanied by worsening HRQoL. HRQoL was assessed using the cancer-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire QLQ-C30, the EuroQol EQ-5D overall utility and EuroQol EQ visual analogue scale. In both studies, progression was evaluated by independent review using RECIST criteria (primary end point) and also by investigator assessment. The relationship between tumour progression and HRQoL was evaluated using analysis of covariance and a longitudinal model RESULTS: Compliance with HRQoL questionnaire completion was high. In both studies, patients with progression consistently experienced numerically poorer HRQoL at the time of progression than patients without progression. Differences in mean scores were statistically significant (p<0.05) between patients with and without progression at week 4 in all analyses in LUX-Lung 1 and at multiple time points in LUX-Lung 3. Results from the longitudinal analysis showed that progression (by independent review and investigator assessment) appears to have consistent negative impact on all three HRQoL measures (all p<0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: Tumour progression in patients with NSCLC was associated with statistically significant worsening in HRQoL. These findings confirm the value of PFS as a patient-relevant end point [SEP] Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy; Afatinib; Disease-Free Survival; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Quality of Life; Quinazolines/therapeutic use; Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors; Treatment Outcome; ONCOLOGY
72	1	Negative illness perceptions are associated with impaired quality of life in patients after long-term remission of Cushing's syndrome [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Illness perceptions pertain to the pattern of beliefs patients develop about their illness. Illness perceptions are determinants of quality of life (QoL). Factors contributing to persisting impaired QoL after Cushing's syndrome (CS) remain largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore illness perceptions, as potentially modifiable psychological factors, in relation to QoL in patients with long-term remission of CS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We included patients with long-term remission of CS (n=52). Illness perceptions were evaluated using the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ)-Revised, and QoL was measured using the physical symptom checklist, EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D), and the CushingQoL. Reference data were derived from recent studies and included patients with vestibular schwannoma (n=80), acute (n=35) or chronic (n=63) pain, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=171). RESULTS: Illness perceptions showed a strong correlation with QoL Patients with CS scored distinctively more negative on the IPQ compared with patients with vestibular schwannoma and patients with acute pain, and also reported more illness-related complaints (all P<0.01). There were also some differences in illness perceptions between patients with CS and patients with chronic pain and patients with COPD, but there was no distinct pattern CONCLUSIONS: Patients after long-term remission of CS report more negative illness perceptions compared with patients with other acute or chronic conditions. Further research is needed to assess whether QoL in CS can be improved by addressing these illness perceptions, for example, by a self-management intervention program [SEP] Adult; Aged; Causality; Chronic Disease; Cushing Syndrome/psychology/radiotherapy/surgery; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone/blood; Hypopituitarism/etiology/psychology; Illness Behavior; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Neuroma, Acoustic/psychology; Pain/etiology; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/psychology; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires
73	0	[Reference guidelines for the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey version 2 based on the Catalan general population] [SEP] BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The SF-12 health survey is the short version of the SF-36. The main interpretation strategy for these health related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires is the use of population based reference values. This study aims to obtain the population based norms for the Spanish version of SF-12 version 2 (SF-12v2), to evaluate its construct validity and to compare the scores obtained by the standard and the specific method of calculation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of the Catalan Health Interview Survey (n=4,261), representative of the general non-institutionalized population. Median and percentiles were calculated for each of the 8 dimensions and for the component summaries, stratified by sex and age groups. The construct validity was evaluated by comparing known groups, applying ANOVA. RESULTS: The results for the known groups analysis supported the hypothesis established a priori (P<.001): worse physical health for persons with mobility problems (EQ-5D) (37.8 vs 52), with restriction in activities (41.8 vs 51.2), and with greater number of chronic disorders (from 43.2 to 53.9); and worse mental health with problems of anxiety/depression (EQ-5D) (42.2 vs 51.9). The scores obtained by the 2 different methods of calculation were similar, except for General Health and Vitality CONCLUSIONS: The SF-12v2 is a valid instrument to measure HQRL in our environment. The obtained norms facilitate the interpretation of SF-12v2 scores in the clinical practice, research and health policy. We recommend the use of the specific method of calculation for national HRQL comparison and the standard one for international comparison [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards; Young Adult
74	0	Disease-outcome trees, EQ-5D scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the United States [SEP] Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens [SEP] Campylobacter/isolation & purification; Clostridium perfringens/isolation & purification; Cryptosporidium parvum/isolation & purification; Cyclospora/isolation & purification; Escherichia coli O157/isolation & purification; Food Contamination/analysis; Food Microbiology; Food Safety; Foodborne Diseases/diagnosis/prevention & control; Humans; Listeria monocytogenes/isolation & purification; Population Surveillance; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Salmonella enterica/isolation & purification; Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli/isolation & purification; Shigella/isolation & purification; Toxoplasma/isolation & purification; United States; Vibrio parahaemolyticus/isolation & purification; Yersinia enterocolitica/isolation & purification

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either low-dose 7-day buprenorphine patches (patch strengths of 5, 10, and 20 microg/h, with a maximum dosage of 20 microg/h) or twice-daily prolonged-release tramadol tablets (tablet strengths of 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg, with a maximum dosage of 400 mg/d) over a 12-week open-label treatment period. Supplementary paracetamol was available as rescue medication throughout the study. The primary end point was the difference in BS-11 scores from baseline to the completion of treatment. Noninferiority was assumed if the treatment difference on the BS-11 scale was -1.5 boxes, indicating a clinically meaningful result. Secondary efficacy variables were rescue medication use, sleep disturbance and quality of sleep, and patients' and investigators' global assessments of pain relief. In addition, patient preference was assessed at the completion visit by asking patients whether, given equal pain relief, they would prefer basic treatment for OA pain with a patch applied once weekly or a tablet taken twice daily Exploratory variables included investigators' assessments of patients' pain, stiffness, and ability to perform daily activities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index); patients' quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D health states index and EuroQol visual analog scale); and abuse and diversion of study drug. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients (69 receiving 7-day buprenorphine patches and 65 receiving tramadol tablets) were randomized and received >or=1 dose of study medication. A respective 98.6% and 100% of the 2 treatment groups were white, with mean (SD) ages of 64.4 (11.1) and 64.2 (9.3) years. Both treatments were associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in pain from baseline to study completion. The least squares mean change from baseline in BS-11 scores in the 7-day buprenorphine patch and tramadol tablet groups was -2.26 (95% CI, -2.76 to -1.76) and -2.09 (95% CI, -2.61 to -1.58). The efficacy of 7-day buprenorphine patches was noninferior to that of prolonged-release tramadol tablets. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable in the 2 treatment groups: 226 AEs were reported in 61 patients (88.4%) in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group, and 152 AEs were reported in 51 patients (78.5%) in the tramadol group. Ten patients (14.5%) in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group and 19 (29.2%) in the tramadol tablet group withdrew from the study due to AEs. The most common AEs in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group were nausea (30.4%), constipation (18.8%), and dizziness (15.9%); the most common AEs in the tramadol tablet group were nausea (24.6%), fatigue (18.5%), and pain (12.3%). Most patients (47/67 [70.1%] in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group and 43/61 [70.5%] in the tramadol tablet group) reported that they would prefer a 7-day patch to a twice-daily tablet for future pain treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with chronic, moderate to severe OA pain of the hip and/or knee, 7-day low-dose buprenorphine patches were an effective and well-tolerated analgesic. The buprenorphine patches were noninferior to prolonged-release tramadol tablets.

76	1	The relationship between self-reported severe pain and measures of socio-economic disadvantage [SEP] AIMS: To determine the association of severe pain with socioeconomic characteristics. METHODS: Data was extracted from the Health Survey for England (HSE), 2005. The HSE is a series of annual cross-sectional surveys designed to describe the health of people living in private homes in England, from a random sample of 720 postcode sectors. Interviewees were ≥ 16 years. Pain severity was characterised by the EQ-5D. Socioeconomic status was classified by ability to work, social security benefits, the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). RESULTS: Pain status was recorded for 9419 subjects of whom 431 (4.6%) reported severe pain. 156 of those reporting severe pain were of working age. Of these 68 (43.6%) stated they were unable to work due to sickness or disability and 64 (41.0%) claimed a state benefit. After adjusting for disease and demographic variables, severe pain was associated with the IMD with an odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI 1.16-2.34, p=0.005), NS-SEC (OR=2.94; 95% CI 1.76-4.91) and equivalised household income (lowest versus highest quintile; OR=2.58 (95% CI 1.46-4.57, p=0.001) CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant associations between pain and socio-economic disadvantage. Apart from the direct impact upon the individual, this clearly has wider societal implications in terms of additional health and social care costs for affected people [SEP] Adult; Aged; Chronic Pain/economics/epidemiology/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; England/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Self Report/standards; Severity of Illness Index
77	1	Can adult weights be used to value child health states? Testing the influence of perspective in valuing EQ-5D-Y [SEP] PURPOSE: To test whether or not adults assign the same values to hypothetical health states that describe health in adults as when those same descriptions refer to the health of a child. METHODS: A two-part self-completion questionnaire was designed in which respondents were asked firstly to rate a fixed set of EQ-5D-Y health states on a 0-100 visual analogue scale as if they themselves were in these states. Two versions of the questionnaire were produced each with a different second part. One version instructed respondents to value the same states but to imagine them describing another adult. The second version required respondents to value these states as if they applied to a 10-year-old child Questionnaires were distributed to adults recruited in three countries (Germany, Spain and England) using convenience sampling methods. RESULTS: A total of 1085 questionnaires were completed. Despite some significant differences in the characteristics of the achieved samples in the three countries involved, the rank order of health states was largely consistent across each adult/child reference perspective. In all countries, the mean values were lower when health states described children rather than adults. Significant differences were found for 16/24 states when values for those states applied to adult respondent themselves were compared with the values for those states applied to a 10-year-old child. A near-uniform pattern was found across all three countries in which health state values for children were found to be lower than for adults. CONCLUSIONS: Values for health states when ascribed to adults are higher than when those same states are associated with children. Were EQ-5D-3L values for adults applied to EQ-5D-Y health states, then this would effectively lead to an misrepresentation of the value assigned to a health status in children [SEP] Adult; Child Health/trends; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Children; EQ-5D; EQ-5D-Y; Valuation of health
78	0	Acupuncture for functional dyspepsia: study protocol for a two-center, randomized controlled trial [SEP] BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common health problem currently without any optimal treatments. Acupuncture has been traditionally sought as a treatment for FD. The aim of this study is to investigate whether acupuncture treatment helps improve symptoms of FD. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-center, randomized, waitlist-controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate whether acupuncture treatment improves FD symptoms. Seventy six participants aged 18 to 75 years with FD as diagnosed by Rome III criteria will be recruited from August 2013 to January 2014 at two Korean Medicine hospitals. They will be randomly allocated either into eight sessions of partially individualized acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks or a waitlist group. The acupuncture group will then be followed-up for 3 weeks with six telephone visits and a final visit will be paid at 8 weeks. The waitlist group will receive the identical acupuncture treatment after a 4-week waiting period. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders with adequate symptom relief and the secondary outcomes include Nepean dyspepsia index, EQ-5D, FD-related quality of life, Beck's depression inventory, state-trait anxiety inventory questionnaire, and level of ghrelin hormone. The protocol was approved by the participating centers' Institutional Review Boards. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will help clarify not only whether the acupuncture treatment is beneficial for symptom improvement in FD patients but also to elucidate the related mechanisms of how acupuncture might work.

79	0	Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of Singapore English and Chinese Versions of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) in knee osteoarthritis patients undergoing total knee replacement [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To cross-culturally adapt and validate Singapore English and Chinese versions of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. METHODS: Singapore English and Chinese OKS versions were cross-culturally adapted from the source English version following standard guidelines (including cognitive debriefing), and validated by interviewing patients in English or Chinese using an identical, pretested questionnaire containing the OKS, Short Form 36, and EQ-5D. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, dimensionality using principal component factor analysis and item-total correlations, convergent and divergent construct validity by assessing six and three a priori hypotheses, respectively. RESULTS: The Singapore English and Chinese OKS were well accepted by patients in pilot testing. When administered to a consecutive sample of 127 English and 131 Chinese-speaking Singaporeans with knee OA (mean age 66 years, 83% female, mean duration of OA 6 years, Chinese:Malay:Indian:Others=78:7.9:11:3.1% for English version), Cronbach's alpha exceeded 0.8 and factor analysis yielded three factors for both versions. Hypothesized item-total correlations (Spearman's rho > or = 0.4) were observed for all items except limping, kneeling, and night knee pain in both versions. Convergent construct validity was supported by the presence of hypothesized moderate/strong correlations (rho=0.37-0.73) for six and five a priori hypotheses in English and Chinese versions, respectively. Divergent construct validity was supported by the presence of weak correlations (rho=0.09-0.30) for all three a priori hypotheses in both versions. CONCLUSION: Singapore English and Chinese OKS demonstrated good patient acceptability and psychometric properties (including construct validity) among multiethnic Asian patients with knee OA undergoing TKR [SEP] Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/rehabilitation; Asia/ethnology; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Singapore/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards; Treatment Outcome
80	0	Development of a screening tool for risk of locomotive syndrome in the elderly: the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of a new questionnaire, the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25), for early detection of locomotive syndrome. METHODS: This new screening tool was designed to detect Japanese individuals under high-risk conditions who may soon require care services because of problems of the locomotive organs. Content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, internal-consistency reliability, and reproducibility (test-retest reliability) were examined using psychometric analysis, and a cutoff score to detect locomotive syndrome was determined. To investigate construct validity of the GLFS-25 and determine the cutoff score, the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) were used. RESULTS: Study 1 analyzed 711 Japanese elderly people ≥65 years old. No floor or ceiling effects were included in the GLFS-25. Internal consistency was confirmed by a Cronbach's α reliability coefficient of 0.961. As for the association between the GLFS-25 and European Quality of Life Scale-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85 (P < 0.001), showing excellent concurrent validity of the GLFS-25 Categorical principal component analysis showed that the construct structure consisted of one item cluster or the GLFS-25 was unifactorial. The AIC showed that one cluster of seven items was located in the center, with significant associations with the other five clusters. In study 2, 205 individuals were analyzed, and the test-retest interclass correlation was satisfactory (range 0.712-0.924). The cutoff score for identifying locomotive syndrome was set at 16 Validity and reliability of this new measurement were psychometrically confirmed as sufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The GLFS-25 offers a valid and reliable questionnaire scale for detecting locomotive syndrome in elderly Japanese individuals [SEP] Accidental Falls/statistics & numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Humans; Japan/epidemiology; Locomotion/physiology; Male; Mass Screening/methods; Mobility Limitation; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Syndrome
81	1	The influence of choice of therapy on quality of life in patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome [SEP] OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare quality of life (QoL) after surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet versus non-operative therapy in patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (N-TOS). DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 46 patients, diagnosed with N-TOS between 1999 and 2008. Twenty-four operated and 22 conservatively treated patients were sent questionnaires on their current symptoms and QoL. A matched control group (n = 24) of healthy individuals was selected for QoL comparison. Statistics were performed with linear and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed a significant QoL difference between the three groups (p = 0.001). Separate analysis between groups demonstrated that all patients with N-TOS-like symptoms have a lower QoL than healthy controls (p = 0.001 resp. p  < or =  0.000). No difference was found between conservatively and surgically treated patients (p = 0.26). EQ-5D response rate was 83%. Of the 24 surgically treated patients, 15 would choose surgery again in a similar situation, although 4 did not benefit in terms of symptom reduction. Symptom relief and VAS pain scores in the conservatively and surgically treated patients did not show significant differences (p = 0.95 resp. p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: All patients with N-TOS have a significantly decreased QoL compared with healthy individuals, regardless of the type of therapy they received. In this small study, surgical decompression fails to improve QoL in patients with N-TOS to the level measured in the healthy control group, despite symptom reduction consistent with previous reports Variables significantly associated with outcome were duration of symptoms and localisation (variables included in the prediction model: age, sex, duration of symptoms, presence of paraesthesias, localisation, Adson's, Wright's and Roos' test, history of trauma, cervical arthrosis). In the perspective of QoL, the benefit of decompressive surgery is questionable. Improving patient selection seems imperative in order to achieve better results in our surgically treated patients [SEP] Adult; Choice Behavior; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Management; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Ribs/surgery; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thoracic Outlet Syndrome/therapy; Treatment Outcome
82	1	Operationalising the capability approach as an outcome measure in public health: The development of the OCAP-18 [SEP] There is growing interest in operationalising the capability approach to measure quality of life. This paper reports the results of a research project undertaken in 2007 that sought to reduce and refine a longer survey in order to provide a summary measure of wellbeing and capability in the realm of public health. The reduction and refinement of the questionnaire took place across a number of stages, using both qualitative (five focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews) and quantitative (secondary data analysis, N = 1048 and primary data collection using postal surveys and interviews, N = 45) approaches. The questionnaire was reduced from its original 60+ questions to 24 questions (including demographic questions). Each of Nussbaum's ten Central Human Capabilities are measured using one (or more) of the 18 specific capability items which are included in the questionnaire (referred to as the OCAP-18). Analysis of the questionnaire responses (N = 198) found that respondents differed with respect to the levels of capabilities they reported, and that these capabilities appear to be sensitive to one's gender, age, income and deprivation decile. An index of capability, estimated by assuming equal weight for each capability question, found that the average level of capability amongst respondents was 12.44 (range 3-17.75). This index was found to be highly correlated with a measure of health (EQ-5D) and wellbeing (global QoL), although some differences were apparent. This project operationalised the capability approach to produce an instrument to measure the effectiveness (and cost effectiveness) of public health interventions; the resulting OCAP-18 appears to be responsive and measure something supplementary to health and wellbeing, thus offers a promising addition to the current suite of outcome measures that are available [SEP] Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Public Health; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Capability approach; Outcome measurement; Public health; Questionnaire development; Survey instrument; United Kingdom
83	1	Economic evaluation alongside a single RCT of an integrative psychotherapeutic nursing home programme [SEP] BACKGROUND: There is an 80% prevalence of two or more psychiatric symptoms in psychogeriatric patients. Multiple psychiatric symptoms (MPS) have many negative effects on quality of life of the patient as well as on caregiver burden and competence. Irrespective of the effectiveness of an intervention programme, it is important to take into account its economic aspects. METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a single open RCT and conducted between 2001 and 2006. The patients who met the selection criteria were asked to participate in the RCT. After the patient or his caregiver signed a written informed consent form, he was then randomly assigned to either IRR or UC.The costs and effects of IRR were compared to those of UC. We assessed the cost-utility of IRR as well as the cost-effectiveness of both conditions. Primary outcome variable: severity of MPS (NPI) of patients; secondary outcome variables: general caregiver burden (CB) and caregiver competence (CCL), quality of life (EQ5D) of the patient, and total medical costs per patient (TiC-P). Cost-utility was evaluated on the basis of differences in total medical costs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by comparing differences of total medical costs and effects on NPI, CB and CCL (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio: ICER). CEAC-analyses were performed for QALY and NPI-severity. All significant testing was fixed at p<0.05 (two-tailed) The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT)-principle. A complete cases approach (CC) was used. RESULTS: IRR turned out to be non-significantly, 10.5% more expensive than UC (€ 36 per day). The number of QALYs was 0.01 higher (non-significant) in IRR, resulting in € 276,290 per QALY According to the ICER-method, IRR was significantly more cost-effective on NPI-sum-severity of the patient (up to 34%), CB and CCL (up to 50%), with ICERs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found on QALYs. In IRR patients improved significantly more on severity of MPS, and caregivers on general burden and competence, with incremental costs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. The surplus costs of IRR are considered acceptable, taking into account the high societal costs of suffering from MPS of psychogeriatric patients and the high burden of caregivers. The large discrepancy in economic evaluation between QALYs (based on EQ5D) and ICERs (based on clinically relevant outcomes) demands further research on the validity of EQ5D in psychogeriatric cost-utility studies.

84	1	Cost-effectiveness of a Home-Exercise Program Among Older People After Hospitalization [SEP] BACKGROUND: Older people who have been recently discharged from hospital are at increased risk of falls and deterioration in physical functioning. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 12-month home-exercise program for older adults after hospitalization. METHOD: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial. The analysis was conducted from the health and community service provider perspective. A total of 340 people aged 60 years and older, with a recent hospital admission, were randomized into exercise and usual care control groups. Incremental costs per extra person showing improvement in mobility performance (using the Short Physical Performance Battery), per person indicating improvement in health (self-reported using a 3-point Likert scale) and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (utility measured using the EQ-5D) were estimated. Uncertainty was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognition (above the median MMSE score of 28) also were undertaken RESULTS: The average cost of the intervention was $A751 per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the program relative to usual care was $A22,958 per extra person showing an improvement in mobility, $A19,020 per extra person indicating an improvement in health, and $A77,403 per QALY. The acceptability curve demonstrates that the intervention had an 80% probability of being cost-effective relative to the control at a threshold of $A48,000 per extra person achieving mobility improvement and $A36,000 indicating an improvement in self-reported health. There was no threshold value at which the program can be considered as having an 80% probability of cost-effectiveness for the QALY outcome. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognitive status indicated improved cost-effectiveness for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: The exercise intervention appeared to offer reasonable value for money for mobility outcomes and self-reported health status. Value for money for all measures was greater in the higher cognitive status subgroup [SEP] Accidental Falls/prevention & control; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Exercise Therapy/economics; Female; Home Care Services/economics; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Patient Discharge; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Older people; exercise programs; fall prevention; hospitalization

PRIMARY MEASURES: a composite score reflecting use of benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazide diuretics; secondary measures: use of medication reviews, occurrence of falls, quality of life (as assessed by SF-12 and EQ-5D survey scores. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, participants in the intervention group had increased odds of having an improved medication use composite score (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-2.85) at 4-month follow-up but not at 12 months. At 4-month follow-up, the intervention group had reduced odds of using NSAIDs (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99) and showed a non-significant reduction in use of benzodiazepines (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20-1.30) and thiazide diuretics (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.48-1.01) Changes in drug use were not significant at 12-month follow-up. At 12 months, intervention-group participants had lower adjusted ORs (AORs) for having a fall (AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), injury (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96), and injury requiring medical attention (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.70). Quality-of-life scores were unaffected by the intervention. CONCLUSION: Education and systems for medication review conducted by GPs can be used to improve use of medicines. These interventions are associated with a reduction in falls among older people, without adverse effects on quality of life [SEP] Accidental Falls/statistics & numerical data; Aged; Cluster Analysis; Drug Utilization Review/organization & administration; Family Practice/education; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Humans; New South Wales; Pharmacology, Clinical/education; Program Evaluation; Quality of Life
86	0	"Global long-term study on motor and non-motor symptoms and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in routine care of advanced Parkinson's disease patients; 12-month interim outcomes [SEP] INTRODUCTION: Intermittent oral delivery of levodopa is a major contributing factor for motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) into the jejunum using a portable pump via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) improves motor complications and quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVES: To record long-term effectiveness of advanced PD patients undergoing LCIG infusion in routine care, by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), PDQ-8 and EQ-5D questionnaires. METHODS: Overall, 375 patients from 75 movement disorder centers in 18 countries were enrolled in this prospective non-interventional study. The 12-month interim outcomes of the first 172 included patients are presented here. RESULTS: There were reductions of mean daily ""Off"" time from baseline (BL) (7.1 ± 3.5 h) and ""On"" time with dyskinesias (5.2 ± 4.5 h) at month 12 (M12) of -4.7 ± 3.4 and -1.7 ± 5.0 h respectively (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0228). UPDRS II and III ""On"" scores decreased from BL to M12 (p = 0.0107 and p = 0.0128). Total NMSS and PDQ-8 scores improved at M12 (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0100). Mean LCIG dose administered through PEG at first visit (day after implantation) was 1304 ± 618 mg/day and remained stable through M12. Continuous LCIG infusion tolerability and adverse drug reactions were consistent with the known safety profile of previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: This observational, routine-care study supports long-term safety and efficacy of LCIG infusion in advanced PD including motor, non-motor and QoL improvements [SEP] Aged; Antiparkinson Agents/administration & dosage; Carbidopa/administration & dosage; Europe; Female; Gels/therapeutic use; Humans; International Cooperation; Intestines/physiology; Levodopa/administration & dosage; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease/drug therapy/physiopathology; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Advanced Parkinson's disease; Duodenal levodopa-carbidopa infusion; Motor symptoms; Non-motor symptoms; Quality of life; Routine patient care"
87	0	Quality of life and satisfaction with treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes: results in Spain of the PANORAMA study [SEP] OBJECTIVES: Few studies are available on quality of life and treatment satisfaction of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both of them were the primary objectives of the PANORAMA (NCT00916513) study. Metabolic control, treatment patterns, and management by healthcare professionals were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study randomly recruited>40 year-old patients with T2DM from Spanish healthcare centers. HbA1c was measured using the same technique in all patients, who also completed quality of life (EQ-5D and ADDQoL) and treatment satisfaction (DTSQ) questionnaires and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS-II). RESULTS: Fifty-four investigators recruited 751 patients, 60.3% of whom had HbA1c levels <7% Approximately 25% of patients on monotherapy had HbA1c values ≥ 7%, Patients with longer disease duration and more complex treatments, especially with insulin, showed the poorer control. Despite good overall treatment satisfaction (mean 29.3±6.1, 0 to 36-point scale), patients with a poorer metabolic control, previous hypoglycemia episodes, and more complex therapies had a worse QoL and a greater fear of suffering hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in metabolic control, there are still areas to improve. Early addition of safe drugs to monotherapy would help achieve control objectives without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, and delaying the start of insulin therapy. This would also improve QoL and treatment satisfaction [SEP] Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Combined Modality Therapy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Complications/epidemiology/psychology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/epidemiology/psychology/therapy; Diet, Diabetic/psychology; Europe; Exercise Therapy/psychology; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis; Humans; Hypoglycemia/chemically induced/etiology/psychology; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Insulin/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Patient Compliance; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Risk; Spain/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Calidad de vida; Diabetes mellitus tipo 2; Quality of life; Satisfacción con el tratamiento; Treatment satisfaction; Type 2 diabetes mellitus
88	1	The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of minimal access surgery amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease - a UK collaborative study. The REFLUX trial [SEP] OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical management amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) judged suitable for both policies. DESIGN: Relative clinical effectiveness was assessed by a randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups) comparing a laparoscopic surgery-based policy with a continued medical management policy. The economic evaluation compared the cost-effectiveness of the two management policies in order to identify the most efficient provision of future care and describe the resource impact that various policies for fundoplication would have on the NHS. SETTING: A total of 21 hospitals throughout the UK with a local partnership between surgeon(s) and gastroenterologist(s) who shared the secondary care of patients with GORD. PARTICIPANTS: The 810 participants, who were identified retrospectively or prospectively via their participating clinicians, had both documented evidence of GORD (endoscopy and/or manometry/24-hour pH monitoring) and symptoms for longer than 12 months. In addition, the recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain about which management policy was best. INTERVENTION: Of the 810 eligible patients who consented to participate, 357 were recruited to the randomised arm of the trial (178 allocated to surgical management, 179 allocated to continued, but optimised, medical management) and 453 recruited to the parallel non-randomised preference arm (261 chose surgical management, 192 chose to continue with best medical management). The type of fundoplication was left to the discretion of the surgeon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a baseline REFLUX questionnaire, developed specifically for this study, containing a disease-specific outcome measure, the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-36), the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Beliefs about Medicines and Surgery questionnaires (BMQ/BSQ). Postal questionnaires were completed at participant-specific time intervals after joining the trial (equivalent to approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery). Intraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons and all other in-hospital data were collected by the research nurse. At the end of the study period, participants completed a discrete choice experiment questionnaire. RESULTS: The randomised groups were well balanced at entry. Participants had been taking GORD medication for a median of 32 months; the mean age of participants was 46 years and 66% were men. Of 178 randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had fundoplication. There was a mixture of clinical and personal reasons why some patients did not have surgery, sometimes related to long waiting times. A total or partial wrap procedure was performed depending on surgeon preference. Complications were uncommon and there were no deaths associated with surgery. By the equivalent of 12 months after surgery, 38% in the randomised surgical group (14% amongst those who had surgery) were taking reflux medication compared with 90% in the randomised medical group. There were substantial differences (one-third to one-half standard deviation) favouring the randomised surgical group across the health status measures, the size depending on assumptions about the proportion that actually had fundoplication. These differences were the same or somewhat smaller than differences observed at 3 months. The lower the REFLUX score, the worse the symptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit observed after surgery. The preference surgical group had the lowest REFLUX scores at baseline. These scores improved substantially after surgery, and by 12 months they were better than those in the preference medical group. The BMQ/BSQ and discrete choice experiment did distinguish the preference groups from each other and from the randomised groups. The latter indicated that the risk of serious complications was the most important single attribute of a treatment option. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the surgery policy was more costly (mean 2049 pounds) but also more effective [+0.088 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. The estimated incremental cost per QALY was 19,000-23,000 pounds, with a probability between 46% (when 62% received surgery) and 19% (when all received surgery) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Modelling plausible longer-term scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after surgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds, but applying a range of alternative scenarios indicated wide uncertainty. The expected value of perfect information was greatest for longer-term quality of life and proportions of surgical patients requiring medication. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients requiring long-term medication to control symptoms of GORD, surgical management significantly increases general and reflux-specific health-related quality of life measures, at least up to 12 months after surgery. Complications of surgery were rare. A surgical policy is, however, more costly than continued medical management. At a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY it may well be cost-effective, especially when putative longer-term benefits are taken into account, but this is uncertain. The more troublesome the symptoms, the greater the potential benefit from surgery. Uncertainty about cost-effectiveness would be greatly reduced by more reliable information about relative longer-term costs and benefits of surgical and medical policies. This could be through extended follow-up of the REFLUX trial cohorts or of other cohorts of fundoplication patients.

89	1	Exploring non-health outcomes of health promotion: the perspective of participants in a lifestyle behaviour change intervention [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To provide insights into health promotion outcomes that are not captured by conventional measures of health outcome used in economic evaluation studies, such as EQ5D based QALYs. METHODS: Twelve semi-structured interviews and five focus group discussions were conducted with participants of a randomized controlled trial (n=52) evaluating the effectiveness of a theory-based lifestyle intervention in Dutch adults at risk for diabetes mellitus and/or cardiovascular disease. Transcripts were analysed by two independent researchers using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: In total we identified twelve non-health outcome themes that were important from the participant perspective. Four of these were reported as direct outcomes of the lifestyle intervention and eight were reported as consequences of lifestyle behaviour change. Our findings also suggest that lifestyle behaviour change may have spillover effects to other people in the participants' direct environment. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that in the context of lifestyle behaviour change EQ5D based QALYs capture health promotion outcomes only partially. More insights are needed into non-health outcomes and spillover effects produced by health promotion in other contexts and how participants and society value these. Methods to account for these outcomes within an economic evaluation framework need to be developed and tested [SEP] Adult; Body Image; Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control; Diabetes Mellitus/prevention & control; Female; Focus Groups; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Personal Satisfaction; Risk Reduction Behavior
90	1	"Concurrent comparison of the measurement properties of generic and disease-specific questionnaires in obese inpatients [SEP] BACKGROUND: The concurrent comparison of questionnaires assessing health-related quality of life in the same population is necessary for better appreciating their performance and to select the best instrument for a given purpose (e.g. clinical trials and observational studies). AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the measurement properties of two disease-specific and generic questionnaires: the Obesity-related Well-Being (ORWELL97), the Obesity-Related Disability test (TSD-OC), the EuroQoL, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. MATERIALS/SUBJECTS: Two-hundreds and forty-nine obese inpatients [age 47 (standard deviation, SD 15) years, body mass index 44.4 (SD 5.2) kg/m(2), 69 % female] completed the four questionnaires before and after a 3-week multidisciplinary weight reduction program. Standard measurement properties were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Intra-class correlation coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.90 for most of the instruments and subscales. The standard error of measurement ranged from 9 to 21 % for the generic instruments, and from 9 to 44 % for the specific questionnaires. Missing data and ceiling effects were found for TSD-OC. Responsiveness was similar for all the instruments. The correlations between the change scores of the instruments were small (<0.37). CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to identify a ""best"" instrument, but overall the ORWELL97 seems to show better measurement properties. The two specific instruments measured different constructs and they did not show a clear superior performance compared to the generic questionnaires [SEP] Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity/psychology/therapy; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards; Weight Reduction Programs"
91	1	A durable gain in motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease following repeated caloric vestibular stimulation: A single-case study [SEP] OBJECTIVE: To gain 'first-in-man' evidence that repeated caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS), a non-invasive form of neuro-modulation, can induce a lasting and clinically-relevant reduction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms. METHODS: A 70  yr old male, diagnosed with PD 7 years prior to study enrolment, self-administered CVS at home 2×20 minutes per day for three months using a solid-state portable device. Standardised neuropsychological assessments of motor, cognitive, affective and independent function were carried out prior to stimulation, at the start and end of the sham (month 1) and active (months 2-3) phases, and 5 months post-stimulation. RESULTS: Relative to the pre-stimulation baseline, behavioural improvements that exceeded the minimal detectable change were observed on the EQ5D, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Schwab and England scale, 2 minute walk, Timed up and go, Non-motor symptom assessment scale for PD, Montreal cognitive assessment, Hospital depression scale and Epworth sleepiness scale. The level of change exceeded the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference on all scales for which a threshold has been published. By contrast, little improvement was seen during the sham (i.e., placebo) phase. CONCLUSION: Caloric vestibular stimulation may offer a novel, home-based method of relieving everyday symptoms of PD, and merits further evaluative study [SEP] Affect; Aged; Cognition; Depression/psychology; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease/physiopathology/rehabilitation; Postural Balance; Treatment Outcome; Vestibule, Labyrinth; Treatment; balance; neuro-degeneration
92	1	Long-term effects of Graves' ophthalmopathy on health-related quality of life [SEP] OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term effects of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) on health-related quality of life (HRQL) after the eye treatment is considered to be finished. The aim of this study was to quantify these effects using validated HRQL questionnaires. DESIGN: A cross-sectional follow-up study was carried out in GO patients who had started radiotherapy and/or prednisone treatment between 1982 and 1992. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2000 these patients received an HRQL questionnaire containing the SF-36, EuroQol and GO-QOL questionnaires. All patients were invited for a follow-up ophthalmological examination. HRQL scores of the respondents were compared with those of two reference populations of 'healthy' persons and to scores of several other GO populations. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-eight patients were included; 163 completed the HRQL questionnaire and 154 visited the outpatient clinic. The median follow-up was 11.7 years. A considerable number of symptoms related to GO were found. More than half of the patients had diplopia and 28% had a low visual acuity. Sixty per cent had a proptosis of at least 20 mm. The HRQL scores were considerably better than those of newly diagnosed GO patients (untreated) and GO patients who completed the questionnaire during treatment, but worse than those of 'healthy' persons. Although we did not perform a longitudinal study, we included a selected group of patients who had been treated with radiotherapy and/or prednisone in the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam, and though we could not assess HRQL at comparable times after receiving treatment, this is the first study that presents any data on the long-term effects of GO on HRQL. CONCLUSION: GO has a marked negative effect on HRQL, even many years after treatment. These findings suggest that GO should be considered a chronic disease. Aftercare is needed for these patients after their immunosuppressive and surgical treatments [SEP] Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Graves Disease/psychology; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors
93	0	Cross-cultural validation of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure for lupus in Philippines [SEP] OBJECTIVE: LupusPRO is a disease-targeted patient-reported outcome measure that was developed and validated among US patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report the cross-cultural validation results of the LupusPRO English-language version among Filipino SLE patients. METHOD: The 43-item LupusPRO was pretested in 15 SLE individuals, then administered to 106 SLE patients, along with short-form SF36 and the EQ5D visual analogue scale. A mail/drop-back LupusPRO and change in health status item survey were returned within two to three days. Demographics, clinical and serological characteristics, disease activity and damage measured by PGA, SELENA-SLEDAI, LFA Flare, and SLICC-ACR SLE damage index (SDI) were collected. Internal consistency reliability (ICR), test-retest reliability (TRT), convergent validity (corresponding SF36 domains) and criterion validity (against general health and disease activity measures) were tested. Reported p values are two tailed. RESULTS: A total of 121 Filipino SLE subjects (95% women, median age 31.0 ± 16 years) with at least a high school level of English instruction participated. Median (IQR) PGA, SLEDAI and SDI were 0.0 (1.0), 2.0 (10) and 0 (1), respectively. ICR exceeded 0.7 for all domains except the lupus symptoms domain. TRT was greater than 0.85 for all LupusPRO domains. Convergent and criterion validity were observed against corresponding SF36 domains and disease activity measures. The tool was well received by patients. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit. CONCLUSION: English LupusPRO has fair psychometric properties among SLE patients in the Philippines, and is now available for inclusion in clinical trials and longitudinal studies to test responsiveness to change [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Philippines; Psychometrics; Self Report; Young Adult
94	1	Cost effectiveness of laparoscopic versus mini-incision open donor nephrectomy: a randomized study [SEP] BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness remains an issue surrounding the introduction of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN). METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial the cost-effectiveness of LDN versus mini-incision open donor nephrectomy (ODN) was determined. Fifty donors were included in each group. All in-hospital costs were documented. Postoperatively, case record forms were sent to the donors during 1-year follow-up to record return-to-work and societal costs. To offset costs against quality of life, the Euroqol-5D questionnaire was administered preoperatively and 3, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180, and 365 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Mean total costs were euro6,090 (US$7,308) after LDN and euro4,818 ($5,782) after ODN (P<0.001). Disposables influenced the cost difference most. Mean productivity loss was 68 and 75 days after LDN and ODN respectively, corresponding to euro783 ($940) gained per donor after LDN. The main gain in quality of life in the LDN group was realized within 4 weeks postoperatively. LDN resulted in a mean gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years at mean costs of euro1,271 ($1,525) and euro488 ($586) from a healthcare perspective and a societal perspective, respectively This implies that one additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year after LDN costs about euro16,000 ($19,200) from a societal point of view and about euro41,000 ($49,200) from a health-care perspective. Activities other than work were resumed significantly earlier after LDN (66 vs. 91 days, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: In addition to a clinically relevant donor-experienced benefit from LDN, this technique appeared, given a societal perspective, a cost-efficient procedure mainly due to less productivity losses [SEP] Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Employment; Female; Hospitalization/economics; Humans; Laparoscopy/economics; Living Donors; Male; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy/economics/rehabilitation; Netherlands; Quality of Life; Time Factors
95	1	Evaluation of pain and its effect on quality of life and functioning in men with spinal cord injury [SEP] BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most important consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI). It may affect several aspects of life, especially the quality of life (QoL). Hence, this study was conducted to establish an understanding of pain and its correlates and effects on patients with SCI in our community. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 58 male veterans suffering from SCI were admitted to our center for a regular follow-up. Demographic and SCI-related descriptive information were gathered using a self-reported questionnaire. To evaluate the patients' pain quality and the effect of pain on daily life, a questionnaire in 3 parts of lumbar, cervical and shoulder pain was administered. EuroQoL questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 12 were also used to assess the patients' QoL. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45.91 ± 6.69 with mean injury time of 25.54 ± 5.91. forty-four patients (75.9%) reported pain, including lumbar pain (63%), cervical pain (39%) and shoulder pain (51%). The presence of pain was associated with lower QoL. Patients with lumbar pain reported a significant amount of pain affecting their daily life and this effect was higher in patients with lower GHQ score or anxiety/depressive disorder CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain, is a common complaint in veterans with SCI and is inversely associated with functioning and general health status. Lumbar and shoulder pain affects patient's daily living more than cervical pain [SEP] Anxiety; Back pain; Depressive disorder; Musculoskeletal pain; Neck pain; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Shoulder pain; Spinal cord injury
96	1	Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN)--prospective validation of risk prediction models for adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury to use to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care: a cohort study [SEP] OBJECTIVES: To validate risk prediction models for acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to use the best model to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care in the NHS. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Sixty-seven adult critical care units. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to critical care following actual/suspected TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15. INTERVENTIONS: Critical care delivered in a dedicated neurocritical care unit, a combined neuro/general critical care unit within a neuroscience centre or a general critical care unit outside a neuroscience centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) questionnaire and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 6 months following TBI. RESULTS: The final Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) study data set contained 3626 admissions After exclusions, 3210 patients with acute TBI were included. Overall follow-up rate at 6 months was 81%. Of 3210 patients, 101 (3.1%) had no GCS score recorded and 134 (4.2%) had a last pre-sedation GCS score of 15, resulting in 2975 patients for analysis. The most common causes of TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs) (33%), falls (47%) and assault (12%). Patients were predominantly young (mean age 45 years overall) and male (76% overall). Six-month mortality was 22% for RTAs, 32% for falls and 17% for assault. Of survivors at 6 months with a known GOSE category, 44% had severe disability, 30% moderate disability and 26% made a good recovery. Overall, 61% of patients with known outcome had an unfavourable outcome (death or severe disability) at 6 months. Between 35% and 70% of survivors reported problems across the five domains of the EQ-5D-3L. Of the 10 risk models selected for validation, the best discrimination overall was from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI Lab model (IMPACT) (c-index 0.779 for mortality, 0.713 for unfavourable outcome). The model was well calibrated for 6-month mortality but substantially underpredicted the risk of unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between dedicated neurocritical care units and combined neuro/general critical care units. In lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, dedicated neurocritical care units had higher mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at small additional mean costs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,000 per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INB) of £17,000. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggested that the probability that dedicated compared with combined neurocritical care units are cost-effective is around 60%. There were substantial differences in case mix between the 'early' (within 18 hours of presentation) and 'no or late' (after 24 hours) transfer groups. After adjustment, the 'early' transfer group reported higher lifetime QALYs at an additional cost with an ICER of £11,000 and INB of £17,000. CONCLUSIONS: The risk models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to support their use in research but fell below the level required to guide individual patient decision-making. The results suggest that management in a dedicated neurocritical care unit may be cost-effective compared with a combined neuro/general critical care unit (although there is considerable statistical uncertainty) and support current recommendations that all patients with severe TBI would benefit from transfer to a neurosciences centre, regardless of the need for surgery. We recommend further research to improve risk prediction models; consider alternative approaches for handling unobserved confounding; better understand long-term outcomes and alternative pathways of care; and explore equity of access to postcritical care support for patients following acute TBI.

97	0	Incorporation of the experience of patients in the development of a patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) for carpal tunnel syndrome [SEP] BACKGROUND: Regularly, patients are not involved in development of evaluative tools. Investigators define outcomes according to their interests. These can be different with those of the patients. Therefore, it may be difficult for patients to choose between treatment options, because the outcomes' measurements may not reflect their problems in daily life. Most ideally, patients are involved from the beginning in the development of an outcome measurement tool. In this study, a new concept was demonstrated in which a questionnaire was developed in collaboration with patients to evaluate the quality of surgical care of a frequently encountered entity (carpal tunnel syndrome) that is meaningful for and understandable by patients. METHODS: Through a patient participatory research in an academic hospital, 50 consecutive patients who recently underwent surgical decompression of carpal tunnel syndrome were asked to optimize a questionnaire An existing questionnaire was sent to the patients with the request to grade the relevance of each question. They were also offered the possibility to add questions from their point of view. RESULTS: All questions were found relevant Finally, the questionnaire was modified by adding one question proposed by the patients. They wanted to include a question that would evaluate the effect of the treatment. Therefore, a question was introduced to evaluate the effect of the surgery on the symptoms and signs with a six-item Likert scale varying from severely worsened to free of signs and symptoms. Finally, the EQ-5D-5 L was added as a measure of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of patients is essential but until now not usual when a tool for evaluating the success of a treatment is developed. Information that is meaningful for patients but not obligate for researchers can easily be missed in the classical development of outcome measurement tools. This information will be crucial when future patients try to understand the findings of research in order to make an appropriate decision between eventual treatment options [SEP] Aged; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome/surgery; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods; Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome
98	1	Validation of a modified version of the brief pain inventory for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy [SEP] Neuropathic pain is the focus of current clinical research, clinical identification, and treatment. It is unique from nociceptive pain and requires evaluation of the relevance and utility of common pain measures created for other painful conditions. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN). Participants were patients with painful DPN (n=255) enrolled in a DPN Burden of Illness survey referred through 17 outpatient settings (primary care physicians, endocrinologists, neurologists, and anesthesiologists). Patients completed the BPI-DPN, and self-report measures of health-related quality of life, mood sleep, and healthcare utilization Construct, criterion and discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability were evaluated. Principal axis factoring with oblimin rotation revealed two interpretable factors (eigenvalues>1.0), consistent with most published BPI validation studies; a severity scale comprising the four BPI Severity items and an interference scale comprising the seven Interference items, which satisfied criteria for interpretability and model fit. Cronbach's alpha was high (0.94) for both scales. Mean pain Severity was highly correlated with Bodily Pain from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12, version 2 (rs=0.63, P < 0.001), the Pain/Discomfort item in the Euro-QoL (rs=0.58, P < 0.001), and a verbal rating scale measure of pain severity (rs=0.74, P < 0.001). Individual BPI-DPN Interference domains were moderately correlated (rs's >0.5, P < 0.001) with analogous measures, and the Sleep Interference item had a high, significant association with the three primary Medical Outcome Study-Sleep scale subscales (rs's=0.66-71, P < 0.001). Worst Pain and Interference ratings were significantly associated with hospital utilization and outpatient visits due to DPN. These results replicate, in a pure peripheral neuropathic pain condition, the BPI psychometric characteristics documented in populations with nociceptive or mixed pain conditions. The BPI-DPN is a promising instrument in the evaluation of painful DPN [SEP] Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Data Collection; Diabetic Neuropathies/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neuralgia/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology; Pain Measurement/methods; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment/methods; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; United States/epidemiology
99	0	[Cost] effectiveness of withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs versus conservative treatment in older fallers: design of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (IMPROveFALL-study) [SEP] BACKGROUND: Fall incidents represent an increasing public health problem in aging societies worldwide. A major risk factor for falls is the use of fall-risk increasing drugs. The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of a structured medication assessment including the withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs on the number of new falls versus 'care as usual' in older adults presenting at the Emergency Department after a fall. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in hospitals in the Netherlands. Persons aged ≥65 years who visit the Emergency Department due to a fall are invited to participate in this trial. All patients receive a full geriatric assessment at the research outpatient clinic. Patients are randomized between a structured medication assessment including withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs and 'care as usual'. A 3-monthly falls calendar is used for assessing the number of falls, fallers and associated injuries over a one-year follow-up period. Measurements will be at three, six, nine, and twelve months and include functional outcome, healthcare consumption, socio-demographic characteristics, and clinical information. After twelve months a second visit to the research outpatient clinic will be performed, and adherence to the new medication regimen in the intervention group will be measured. The primary outcome will be the incidence of new falls. Secondary outcome measurements are possible health effects of medication withdrawal, health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 and EuroQol-5D), costs, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis DISCUSSION: The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs in older patients as a method for falls reduction.
